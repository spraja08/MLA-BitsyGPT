like a coffin clapt in a canoe,\r","where none can make out what you say or do\r","and up and down the long canals they go,\r","and under the rialto shoot along\r","by night and day, all paces, swift

mourning coaches when the funeral’s done\r","but to my story--'twas some years ago,\r","it may be thirty, forty, more or less,\r","the carnival was at its height, and so\r","were all kinds of

with ease\r","she was not old, nor young, nor at the years\r","which certain people call a 'certain age,'\r","which yet the most uncertain age appears,\r","because i never heard, nor could engage\r","a person yet by prayers, or bribes, or tears,\r","to name, define by speech, or write on page,\r","the period meant precisely by that word,--\r","which surely is exceedingly absurd\r","laura was blooming still, had made the best\r","of time, and time return'd the compliment,\r","and treated her genteelly, so that, 'drest,\r","she look'd extremely well where'er she went;\r","a pretty woman is a welcome guest,\r","and laura's brow a frown had rarely bent;\r","indeed, she shone all smiles, and seem'd to flatter\r","mankind with her black eyes for looking at her\r","she was a married woman; 'tis convenient,\r","because in christian countries 'tis a rule\r","to view their little slips with eyes more lenient;\r","whereas if single ladies play the fool\r","unless within the period intervenient\r","a well-timed wedding makes the scandal cool,\r","i don't know how they ever can get over it,\r","except they manage never to discover it\r","her husband sail'd upon the adriatic,\r","and made some voyages, too, in other seas,\r","and when he lay in quarantine for pratique\r","a forty days' precaution 'gainst disease,\r","his wife would mount, at times, her highest attic,\r","for thence she could discern the ship with ease;\r","he was a merchant trading to aleppo,\r","his name giuseppe--call'd more briefly, beppo\r","he was a man as dusky as a spaniard,\r","sunburnt with travel, yet a portly figure;\r","though colour'd, as it were, within a tan-yard,\r","he was a person both of sense and vigour--\r","a better seaman never yet did man yard;\r","and she, although her manners show'd no rigour,\r","was deem'd a woman of the strictest principle,\r","so much as to be thought almost invincible\r","but several years elapsed since they had met;\r","some people thought the ship was lost, and some\r","that he had somehow blunder'd into debt,\r","and did not like the thought of steering home;\r","and there were several offer'd any bet,\r","or that he would, or that he would not come,\r","for most men till by losing render'd sager\r","will back their own opinions with a wager\r","'tis said that their last parting was pathetic,\r","as partings often are, or ought to be,\r","and their presentiment was quite prophetic,\r","that they should never more each other see,\r","a sort of morbid feeling, half poetic,\r","which i have known occur in two or three\r","when kneeling on the shore upon her sad knee\r","he left this adriatic ariadne\r","and laura waited long, and wept a little,\r","and thought of wearing weeds, as well she might;\r","she almost lost all appetite for victual,\r","and could not sleep with ease along at night;\r","she deem'd the window-frames and shutters brittle\r","against a daring house-breaker or sprite,\r","and so she thought it prudent to connect her\r","with a vice-husband, chiefly to protect her\r","    \r","she chose, and what is there they will not choose,\r","if only you will but oppose their choice?\r","till beppo should return from his long cruise,\r","and bid once more her faithful heart rejoice,\r","a man some women like, and yet abuse--\r","a coxcomb was he by the public voice;\r","a count of wealth, they said, as well as quality,\r","and in his pleasures of great liberality\r","and then he was a count, and then he knew\r","music, and dancing, fiddling, french and tuscan;\r","the last not easy, be it known to you\r","for few italians speak the right etruscan\r","he was a critic upon operas, too,\r","and knew all niceties of the sock and buskin;\r","and no venetian audience could endure a\r","song, scene, or air, when he cried 'seccatura!'\r","his 'bravo' was decisive—for that sound\r","hush'd 'academie' sigh'd in silent awe;\r","the fiddlers trembled as he look'd around,\r","for fear of some false note's detected flaw;\r","the 'prima donna's' tuneful heart would bound,\r","dreading the deep damnation of his 'bah!'\r","soprano, basso, even the contra-alto,\r","wish'd him five fathom under the rialto\r","he patronised the improvisatori,\r","nay, could himself extemporise some stanzas;\r","wrote rhymes, sang songs, could also tell a story,\r","sold pictures, and was skilful in the dance as\r","italians can be--though in this their glory\r","must surely yield the palm to that which france has;\r","in short, he was a perfect cavaliero,\r","and to his very valet seem'd a hero\r","then he was faithful too, as well as amorous;\r","so that no sort of female could complain--\r","although they're now and then a little clamourous,\r","he never put the pretty souls in pain;\r","his heart was one of those which most enamour us,\r","wax to receive, and marble to retain:\r","he was a lover of the good old school,\r","who still become more constant as they cool\r","no wonder such accomplishments should turn\r","a female head, however sage and steady--\r","with scarce a hope that beppo could return,\r","in law he was almost as good as dead, he\r","nor sent, nor wrote, nor show'd the least concern,\r","and she had waited several years already;\r","and really if a man won't let us know\r","that he's alive, he's dead, or should be so\r","besides, within the alps, to every woman,\r","although, god knows! it is a grievous sin\r","'tis, i may say, permitted to have two men;\r","i can't tell who first brought the custom in,\r","but 'cavalier serventes' are quite common,\r","and no one notices nor cares a pin;\r","and we may call this not to say the worst\r","a second marriage which corrupts the first\r","the word was formerly a 'cicisbeo,'\r","but that is now grown vulgar and indecent;\r","the spaniards call the person a 'cortejo,'\r","for the same mode subsists in spain, though recent;\r","in short, it reaches from the po to teio,\r","and may perhaps at last be o'er the sea sent;\r","but heaven preserve old england from such courses!\r","or what becomes of damage and divorces?\r","however, i still think, with all due deference\r","to the fair single part of the creation,\r","that married ladies should preserve the preference\r","in tete-a-tete or general conversation--\r","and this i say without peculiar reference\r","to england, france, or any other nation--\r","because they know the world, and are at ease,\r","and being natural, naturally please\r","'tis true, your budding miss is very charming,\r","but shy and awkward at first coming out,\r","so much alarm'd, that she is quite alarming,\r","all giggle, blush--half pertness, and half-pout--\r","and glancing at mamma, for fear there's harm in\r","what you, she, it, or they, may be about;\r","the nursery still lisps out in all they utter--\r","besides, they always smell of bread and butter\r","but 'cavalier servente' is the phrase\r","used in politest circles to express\r","this supernumary slave, who stays\r","close to the lady as a part of dress--\r","her word the only law which he obeys\r","his is no sinecure, as you may guess;\r","coach, servants, gondola, he goes to call,\r","and carries fan and tippet, gloves and shawl\r","with all its sinful doings, i must say,\r","that italy's a pleasant place to me,\r","who love to see the sun shine every day,\r","and vines not nail’d to walls from tree to tree\r","festoon'd, much like the back scene of a play,\r","or melodrame, which people flock to see\r","when the first act is ended by a dance\r","in vineyards copied from the south of france\r","i like on autumn evenings to ride out,\r","without being forced to bid my groom be sure\r","my cloak is round his middle strapp'd about,\r","because the skies are not the most secure;\r","i know too that, if stopp'd upon my route\r","where the green alleys windingly allure,\r","    \r","reeling with grapes red waggons choke the way--\r","in england 'twould be dung, dust, or a dray\r","i also like to dine on becaficas,\r","to see the sun set, sure he'll rise tomorrow,\r","not through a misty morning twinkling weak as\r","a drunken man's dead eye in maudlin sorrow,\r","but with all heaven t' himself; the day will break as\r","beauteous as cloudless, nor be forced to borrow\r","that sort of farthing candlelight which glimmers\r","where reeking london's smoky caldron simmers\r","i love the language, that soft bastard latin,\r","which melts like kisses from a female mouth,\r","and sounds as if it should be writ on satin,\r","with syllables which breathe of the sweet south,\r","and gentle liquids gliding all so pat in\r","that not a single accent seems uncouth--\r","like our harsh northern whistling, grunting guttural,\r","which we're obliged to hiss, and spit, and sputter all\r","i like the women too forgive my folly!\r","from the rich peasant cheek of ruddy bronze,\r","and large black eyes that flash on you a volley\r","of rays that say a thousand things at once,\r","to the high dama's brow, more melancholy,\r","but clear, and with a wild and liquid glance,\r","heart on her lips, and soul within her eyes,\r","soft as her clime, and sunny as her skies\r","eve of the land which still is paradise!\r","italian beauty! didst thou not inspire\r","raphael, who died in thy embrace, and vies\r","with all we know of heaven, or can desire\r","in what he hath bequeath'd us?--in what guise,\r","though flashing from the fervour of the lyre,\r","would words describe thy past and present glow,\r","while yet canova can create below?\r","   \r","'england! with all thy faults i love thee still!'\r","i said at calais, and have not forgot

change meant;\r","in such affairs there probably are few\r","who have not had this pouting sort of squabble,\r","from sinners of high station to the rabble\r","but, on the whole, they were a happy

have said\r","some six and thirty stanzas back, and so\r","laura the usual preparations made,\r","which you do when your mind's made up to go\r","to-night to mrs boehm's masquerade,\r","spectator, or

again,\r","he thought himself in duty bound to do so,\r","and not be always thieving on the main;\r","lonely he felt at times as robin crusoe,\r","and so he hired a vessel come from spain,\r","bound for corfu: she was a fine polacca,\r","mann'd with twee hands, and laden with tobacco\r","himself, and much heaven knows how gotten! cash,\r","he then embark'd, with risk of life and limb,\r","and got clear off, although the attempt was rash\r","he said that providence protected him;\r","for my part, i say nothing--lest we clash\r","in our opinions--well, the ship was trim,\r","set sail, and kept her reckoning fairly on,\r","except three days of calm when off cape bonn\r","xcv\r","they reach'd the island, he transferr'd his lading\r","and self and live stock to another bottom,\r","and pass'd for a true turkey-merchant, trading\r","with goods of various names--but i've forgot 'em\r","however, he got off by this evading,\r","or else the people would perhaps have shot him;\r","and thus at

utterance, save the shrug or sign,\r","deal round to happy fools its speechless obloquy\r","but i have lived, and have not lived in vain:\r","my mind may lose its force, my blood its fire,\r","and my

rear\r","their ivy mantles, and the solemn scene\r","derives from thee a sense so deep and clear\r","that we become a part of what has been,\r","and grow unto the spot, all-seeing but unseen\r","and here the buzz of eager nations ran,\r","in murmur'd pity, or loud-roar'd applause,\r","as man was slaughter'd by his fellow-man\r","and wherefore slaughter'd? wherefore, but because\r","such were the bloody circus' genial laws,\r","and the imperial pleasure -- wherefore not?\r","what matters where we fall to fill the maws\r","of worms -- on battle-plains or listed spot?\r","both are but theatres -- where the chief actors rot\r","i see before me the gladiator lie:\r","he leans upon his hand -- his manly brow\r","consents to death, but conquers agony,\r","and his droop'd head sinks gradually low --\r","and through his side the last drops, ebbing slow\r","from the red gash, fall heavy, one by one,\r","like the first of a thunder-shower; and now\r","the arena swims around him -- he is gone,\r","ere ceased the inhuman shout which hail'd the wretch who won\r","he heard it, but he heeded not -- his eyes\r","were with his heart, and that was far away;\r","he reck'd not of the life he lost nor prize,\r","but where his rude hut by the danube lay,\r","there where his young barbarians all at play,\r","there was their dacian mother -- he, their sire,\r","butcher'd to make a roman holiday --\r","all this rush'd with his blood -- shall he expire\r","and unavenged? arise! ye goths, and glut your ire!\r","         \r","but here, where murder breathed her bloody steam;\r","and here, where buzzing nations choked the ways,\r","and roar'd or murmur'd like a mountain stream\r","dashing or winding as its torrent strays;\r","here, where the roman million's blame or praise\r","was death or life, the playthings of a crowd,\r","my voice sounds much -- and fall the stars faint rays\r","on the arena void -- seats crush'd -- walls bow'd --\r","and galleries, where my steps seem echoes strangely loud\r","a ruin -- yet what a ruin! from its mass\r","walls, palaces, half-cities, have been rear'd;\r","yet oft the enormous skeleton ye pass,\r","and marvel where the spoil could have appear'd\r","hath it indeed been plunder'd, or but clear'd?\r","alas! developed, opens the decay,\r","when the colossal fabric's form is near'd:\r","it will not bear the brightness of the day,\r","which streams too much on all -- years -- man -- have reft away\r","but when the rising moon begins to climb\r","its topmost arch, and gently pauses there;\r","when the stars twinkle through the loops of time,\r","and the low night-breeze waves along the air\r","the garland-forest, which the gray walls wear,\r","like laurels on the bald first casar's head;\r","when the light shines serene

hearts --\r","to art a model; and to him who treads\r","rome for the sake of ages, glory sheds\r","her light through thy sole aperture; to those\r","who worship, here are altars for their beads;\r","and they who feel for genius may repose\r","their eyes on honour'd forms, whose busts around them close\r","there is a dungeon, in whose dim drear light\r","what do i gaze on? nothing: look again!\r","two forms are slowly shadow'd on my sight --\r","two insulated phantoms of the brain:\r","it is not so; i see them full and plain --\r","an old man, and a female young and fair,\r","fresh as a nursing mother, in whose vein\r","the blood is nectar: -- but what doth she there,\r","with her unmantled neck, and bosom white and bare?\r","full swells the deep pure fountain of young life,\r","where on the heart and from the heart we took\r","our first and sweetest nurture, when the wife,\r","blest into mother, in the innocent look,\r","or even the piping cry of lips that brook\r","no pain and small suspense, a joy perceives\r","        \r","man knows not, when from out its cradled nook\r","she sees her little bud put forth its leaves --\r","what may the fruit be yet? i know not -- cain was eve's\r","but here youth offers to old age the food,\r","the milk of his own gift: it is her sire\r","to whom she renders back the debt of blood\r","born with her birth no; he shall not expire\r","while in those warm and lovely veins the fire\r","of health and holy feeling can provide\r","great nature's nile, whose deep stream rises higher\r","than egypt's river: from that gentle side\r","drink, drink and live, old man! heaven's realm holds no such tide\r","cli\r","the starry fable of the milky way\r","has not thy story's purity; it is\r","a constellation of a sweeter ray,\r","and sacred nature triumphs more in this\r","reverse of her decree, than in the abyss\r","where sparkle distant worlds: -- oh, holiest nurse!\r","no drop of that clear stream its way shall miss\r","to thy sire's heart, replenishing its source\r","with life, as our freed souls rejoin the universe\r","turn to the mole which hadrian rear'd on high,\r","imperial mimic of old egypt's piles,\r","colossal copyist of deformity\r","whose travell'd phantasy from the far nile's\r","enormous model, doom'd the artist's toils\r","to build for giants, and for his vain earth,\r","his shrunken ashes, raise this dome: how smiles\r","the gazer's eyes with philosophic mirth,\r","to view the huge design which sprung from such a birth!\r","cli\r","but lo! the dome -- the vast and wondrous dome,\r","to which diana's marvel was a cell --\r","christ's mighty shrine above his martyr's tomb!\r","i have beheld the ephesian's miracle; --\r","              \r","its columns strew the wilderness, and dwell\r","the hyana and the jackal in their shade;\r","i have beheld sophia's bright roofs swell\r","their glittering mass i' the sun, and have survey'd\r","its sanctuary the while the usurping moslem pray'd;\r","but thou, of temples old, or altars new,\r","standest alone, with nothing like to thee --\r","worthiest of god, the holy and the true\r","since zion's desolation, when that he\r","forsook his former city, what could be,\r","of earthly structures, in his honour piled,\r","of a sublimer aspect? majesty,\r","power, glory, strength, and beauty all are aisled\r","in this eternal ark of worship undefiled\r","enter: its grandeur overwhelms thee not;\r","and why? it is not lessen'd; but thy mind,\r","expanded by the genius of the spot,\r","has grown colossal, and can only find\r","a fit abode wherein appear enshrined\r","thy hopes of immortality; and thou\r","shalt one day, if found worthy, so defined,\r","see thy god face to face, as thou dost now\r","his holy of holies, nor be blasted by his brow\r","ci\r","thou movest, but increasing with the advance,\r","like climbing some great alp, which still doth rise,\r","deceived by its gigantic elegance;\r","vastness which grows, but grows to harmonise --\r","all musical in its immensities;\r","rich marbles, richer painting -- shrines where flame\r","the lamps of gold -- and haughty dome which view\r","in air with earth's chief structures, though their frame\r","sits on the firm-set ground, and this the clouds must claim\r","thou seest not all; but piecemeal thou must break,\r","to separate contemplation, the great whole;\r","        \r","and as the ocean many bays will make\r","that ask the eye -- so here condense thy soul\r","to more immediate objects, and control\r","thy thoughts until thy mind hath got by heart\r","its eloquent proportions, and unroll\r","in mighty graduations, part by part,\r","the glory which at once upon thee did not dart,\r","ci\r","not by its fault -- but thine: our outward sense\r","is but of gradual grasp -- and as it is\r","that what we have of feeling most intense\r","outstrips our faint expression; even so this\r","outshining and o'erwhelming edifice\r","fools our fond gaze,and greatest of the great\r","defies at first our nature's littleness,\r","till growing with its growth, we thus dilate\r","our spirits to the size of that they contemplate\r","ci\r","then pause, and be enlighten'd; there is more\r","in such a survey than the sating gaze\r","of wonder pleased, or awe which would adore\r","the worship of the place, or the mere praise\r","of art and its great masters, who could raise\r","what former time, nor skill, nor thought could plan;\r","the fountain of sublimity displays\r","its depth, and thence may draw the mind of man\r","its golden sands, and learn what great conceptions can\r","or, turning to the vatican, go see\r","laocoon's torture dignifying pain --\r","a father's love and mortal's agony\r","with an immortal's patience blending: -- vain\r","the struggle vain, against the coiling strain\r","and gripe, and deepening of the dragon's grasp,\r","the old man's clench; the long unvenom'd chain\r","rivets the living links, -- the enormous asp\r","enforces pang on pang, and stifles gasp on gasp\r","clxi\r","   \r","or view the lord of the unerring bow,\r","the god of life, and poesy, and light --\r","the sun in human limbs array'd, and brow\r","all radiant from his triumph in the fight;\r","the shaft hath just been shot -- the arrow bright\r","with an immortal's vengeance; in his eye\r","and nostril beautiful disdain, and might\r","and majesty, flash their full lightnings by,\r","developing in that once glance the deity\r","but in his delicate form -- a dream of love,\r","shaped by some solitary nymph, whose breast\r","long'd for a deathless lover from above,\r","and madden'd in that vision -- are exprest\r","all that ideal beauty ever bless'd\r","the mind with in its most unearthly mood,\r","when each conception was a heavenly guest --\r","a ray of immortality -- and stood\r","starlike, around, until they gather'd to a god!\r","clxi\r","and if it be prometheus stole from heaven\r","the fire which we endure, it was repaid\r","by him to whom the energy was given\r","which this poetic marble hath array'd\r","with an eternal glory -- which, if made\r","by human hands, is not of human thought;\r","and time himself hath hallow'd it, nor laid\r","one ringlet in the dust -- nor hath it caught\r","a tinge of years, but breathes the flame with which 'twas wrought\r","but where is he, the pilgrim of my song,\r","the being who upheld it through the past?\r","methinks he cometh late and tarries long\r","he is no more -- these breathings are his last;\r","his wanderings done, his visions ebbing fast,\r","and he himself as nothing: -- if he was\r","aught but a phantasy, and could be class'd\r","with forms which live and suffer -- let that pass --\r","his shadow fades away into destruction's mass,\r","              \r","clxv\r","which gathers shadow, substance, life, and all\r","that we inherit in its mortal shroud,\r","and spreads the dim and universal pall\r","through

verge of darkness; rays\r","sadder than saddest night, for they distract the gaze,\r","clxvi\r","and send us prying into the abyss,\r","to gather what we shall be when the frame\r","shall be resoed to

from a sister valley; -- and afar\r","the tiber winds, and the broad ocean laves\r","the latian coast where sprung the epic war,\r","'arms and the man,' whose re-ascending star\r","rose o'er an empire: -- but beneath thy right\r","tully reposed from rome; -- and where yon bar\r","of girdling mountains intercepts the sight\r","the sabine farm was till'd, the weary bard's delight\r","but i forget -- my pilgrim's shrine is won,\r","and he and i must part, -- so let it be, --\r","his task and mine alike are nearly done;\r","yet once more let us look upon the sea;\r","the midland ocean breaks on him and me,\r","and from the alban mount we now behold\r","our friend of youth, that ocean, which when we\r","beheld it last by calpe's rock unfold\r","those waves, we follow'd on till the dark euxine roll'd\r","upon the blue symplegades: long years --\r","long, though not very many -- since have done\r","their work on both; some suffering and some tears\r","        \r","have left us nearly where we had begun:\r","yet not in vain our mortal race hath run;\r","we have had our reward, and it is here, --\r","that we can yet feel gladden'd by the sun,\r","and reap from earth, sea, joy almost as dear\r","as if there were no man to trouble what is clear\r","oh! that the desert were my dwelling-place,\r","with one fair spirit for my minister,\r","that i might all forget the human race,\r","and, hating no one, love but only her!\r","ye elements! -- in whose enobling stir\r","i feel myself exalted -- can ye not\r","accord me such a being? do i err\r","in deeming such inhabit many a spot?\r","though with them to converse can rarely be our lot\r","there is a pleasure in the pathless woods,\r","there is a rapture on the lonely shore,\r","there is society, where none intrudes,\r","by the deep sea, and music in its roar;\r","i love not man the less, but nature more,\r","from these our interviews, in which i steal\r","from all i may be, or have been before,\r","to mingle with the universe, and feel\r","what i can ne'er express, yet cannot all conceal\r","roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean -- roll!\r","ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in vain;\r","man marks the earth with ruin -- his control\r","stops with the shore; upon the watery plain\r","the wrecks are all thy deed, nor doth remain\r","a shadow of man's ravage, save his own,\r","when, for a moment, like a drop of rain,\r","he sinks into thy depths with bubbling groan,\r","without a grave, unknell'd, uncoffin'd, and unknown\r","his steps are not upon thy paths, -- thy fields\r","are not a spoil for him -- thou dost arise\r","and shake him from thee; the vile strength he wields\r","for earth's destruction thou dost all despise,\r","spurning him from thy bosom to the skies,\r","and send'st him shivering in thy playful spray\r","and howling, to his gods, where haply lies\r","his petty hope in some near port or bay,\r","and dashest him again to earth: -- there let him lay\r","the armaments which thunderstrike the walls\r","of rock-built cities bidding nations quake,\r","and monarchs tremble in their capitals,\r","the oak leviathons, whose huge ribs make\r","their clay creator the vain title take\r","of lord of thee, and arbiter of war --\r","these are thy toys, and, as the snowy flake,\r","they melt into thy yeast of waves, which mar\r","alike the armada's pride or spoils of trafalgar\r","thy shores are empires, changed in all save thee --\r","assyria, greece, rome, carthage, what are they?\r","thy waters wash'd them power while they were free,\r","and many a tyrant since; their shores obey\r","the stranger, slave, or savage; their decay\r","has dried up realms to deserts: -- not so thou; --\r","unchangeable, save to thy wild waves' play,\r","time writes no wrinkle on thine azure brow:\r","such as creation's dawn beheld, thou rollest now\r","thou glorious mirror, where the almighty's form\r","glasses itself in tempests; in all time, --\r","calm or convulsed, in breeze, or gale, or storm,\r","icing the pole, or in the torrid clime\r","dark-heaving -- boundless, endless, and sublime,\r","the image of eternity, the throne\r","of the invisible;

sports was on thy breast to be\r","borne, like thy bubbles, onward: from a boy\r","i wanton'd with thy breakers -- they to me\r","were a delight; and if the freshening sea\r","made them a terror -- 'twas a pleasing fear,\r","for i was as it were a child of thee,\r","and trusted to thy billows far and near,\r","and laid my hand upon thy mane -- as i do here\r","my task is done, my song hath ceased, my theme\r","has died into an echo; it is fit\r","the spell should break of this protracted dream\r","the torch shall be extinguish'd which hath lit\r","my midnight lamp -- and what is writ, is writ;\r","would it were worthier! but i am not now\r","that which i have been -- and my visions flit\r","less palpably before me -- and the glow\r","which, in my spirit dwelt is fluttering, faint, and low\r","farewell! a word that must be, and hath been --\r","a sound which makes us linger; -- yet -- farewell!\r","ye! who have traced the pilgrim to the scene\r","which is his last, if in your memories dwell\r","a thought which once was his, if on ye swell\r","a single recollection, not in vain\r","he wore his sandal-shoon and scallop-shell;\r","farewell! with him alone may rest the

forest's shady scene,\r","where things that own not man's dominion dwell,\r","and mortal foot hath ne'er, or rarely been;\r","to climb the trackless mountain all unseen,\r","with the wild flock that never needs a fold;\r","alone o'er steeps and foaming falls to lean;\r","this is not solitude; 'tis but to hold\r","converse with nature's charms, and view her stores unroll'd\r","but midst the crowd, the hum, the shock of men,\r","to hear, to see, to feel, and to possess,\r","and roam along, the world's tir'd denizen,\r","with none who bless us, none whom we can bless;\r","minions of splendour shrinking from distress!\r","none that, with kindred consciousness endued,\r","if we were not, would seem to smile the less\r","of all that flatter'd, follow'd, sought and sued;\r","this is to be alone; this, this is solitude!\r","more blest the life of godly eremite,\r","such as on lonely athos may be seen,\r","watching at eve upon the giant height,\r","that looks o'er waves so blue, skies so serene,\r","        \r","that he who there at such an hour hath been\r","will wistful linger on that hallow'd spot;\r","then slowly tear him from the 'witching scene,\r","sight forth one wish that

gale, the change, the tack,\r","and each well known caprice of wave and wind;\r","pass we the joys and sorrows sailors find,\r","coop'd in their winged sea-girt citadel;\r","the foul, the fair, the contrary, the kind,\r","as breezes rise and fall and billows swell,\r","till on some jocund morn--lo, land! and all is well\r","but not in silence pass calypso's isles,\r","the sister tenants of the middle deep;\r","there for the weary still a haven smiles,\r","though the fair goddess long hath ceas'd to weep,\r","and o'er her cliffs a fruitless watch to keep\r","for him who dar'd prefer a mortal bride:\r","here, too, his boy essay'd the dreadful leap\r","stern mentor urg'd from high to yonder tide;\r","while thus of both bereft, the nymph-queen doubly sigh'd\r","her reign is past, her gentle glories gone:\r","but trust not this; too easy youth, beware!\r","a mortal sovereign holds her dangerous throne,\r","and thou may'st find a new calypso there\r","sweet florence! could another ever share\r","this wayward, loveless heart, it would be thine:\r","but check'd by every tie, i may not dare\r","to cast a worthless offering at thy shrine,\r","nor ask so dear a breast to feel one pang for mine\r","thus harold deem'd, as on that lady's eye\r","he look'd, and met its beam without a thought,\r","     \r","save admiration glancing harmless by:\r","love kept aloof, albeit not far remote,\r","who knew his votary often lost and caught,\r","but knew him as his worshipper no more,\r","and ne'er again the boy his bosom sought:\r","since now he vainly urg'd him to adore,\r","well deem'd the little god his ancient sway was o'er\r","fair florence found, in sooth with some amaze,\r","one who, 'twas said, still sigh'd to all he saw,\r","withstand, unmov'd, the lustre of her gaze,\r","which others hail'd with real, or mimic awe,\r","their hope, their doom, their punishment, their law;\r","all that gay beauty from her bondsmen claims:\r","and much she marvell'd that a youth so raw\r","nor felt, nor feign'd at least, the oft-told flames,\r","which, though sometimes they frown, yet rarely anger dames\r","little knew she that seeming marble-heart,\r","now mask'd in silence or withheld by pride,\r","was not unskilful in the spoiler's art,\r","and spread its snares licentious far and wide;\r","nor from the base pursuit had turn'd aside,\r","as long as aught was worthy to pursue:\r","but harold on such arts no more relied;\r","and had he doated on those eyes so blue,\r","yet never would he join the lover's whining crew\r","not much he kens, i ween, of woman's breast,\r","who thinks that wanton thing is won by sighs;\r","who careth she for hearts when once possess'd?\r","do proper homage to thine idol's eyes;\r","but not too humbly, or she will despise\r","thee and thy suit, though told in moving tropes:\r","disguise ev'n tenderness, if thou art wise;\r","brisk confidence still best with woman copes;\r","pique her and soothe in turn, soon

is hardly worth the cost:\r","youth wasted, minds degraded, honour lost,\r","these are thy fruits, successful passion! these!\r","if, kiindly cruel, early hope is crost,\r","still to the last it rankles, a disease,\r","not to be cur'd when love itself forgets to please\r","away! nor let me loiter in my song,\r","for we have many a mountain-path to tread,\r","and many a varied shore to sail along,\r","by pensive sadness, not by fiction, led--\r","climes, fair withal as every mortal head\r","imagin'd in its little schemes of thought;\r","or e'er in new utopias were ared,\r","to teach man

war,\r","actium, lepanto, fatal trafalgar;\r","mark them unmov'd, for he would not delight\r","born beneath some remote inglorious star\r","in themes of bloody fray, or gallant fight,\r","but loath'd the bravo's trade, and laugh'd at martial wight\r","but when he saw the evening star above\r","leucadia's far-projecting rock of woe,\r","and hail'd the last resort of fruitless love,\r","he felt, or deem'd he felt, no common glow:\r","and as the stately vessel glided slow\r","beneath the shadow of that ancient mount,\r","he watch'd the billows' melancholy flow,\r","and, sunk albeit in thought as he was wont,\r","more placid seem'd his eye, and smooth his pallid front\r","morn dawns; and with it stern albania's hills,\r","dark suli's rocks, and pindus' inland peak,\r","rob'd half in mist, bedew'd with snowy rills,\r","array'd in many a dun and purple streak,\r","arise; and, as the clouds among the break,\r","disclose the dwelling of the mountaineer:\r","here roams the wolf, the eage whets his beak,\r","        \r","birds, beasts of prey, and wilder men appear,\r","and gathering storms around convulse the closing year\r","now harold felt himself at length alone,\r","and bade to christian tongues a long adieu;\r","now he adventur'd on a shore unknown,\r","which all admre, but many dread to view:\r","his breast was arm'd 'gainst fate, his wants were few;\r","peril he sought not, but ne'er shrank to meet,\r","the scene was savage, but the scene was new;\r","this made the ceaseless toil of travel sweet,\r","beat back keen winter's blast, and welcom'd summer's heat\r","here the red cross, for still the cross is here,\r","though sadly scoff'd at by the circumcis'd,\r","forgets that pride to pamper'd priesthood dear;\r","churchman and votary alike despis'd\r","foul

chasing time,\r","yet with a nobler aim than in his youth's fond prime\r","    \r","but soon he knew himself the most unfit\r","of men to herd with man; with whom he held\r","little in common; untaught to submit\r","his thoughts to others, though his soul was quell'd\r","in youth by his own thoughts; still uncompell'd,\r","he would not yield dominion of his mind\r","to spirits against whom his own rebell'd;\r","proud though in desolation; which could find\r","a life within itself, to breathe without mankind\r","where rose the mountains, there to him were friends;\r","where roll'd the ocean, theron was his home;\r","where a blue sky, and glowing clime, extends,\r","he had the passion and the power to roam;\r","the desert, forest, cavern, breaker's foam,\r","were unto him companionship; they spake\r","a mutual language, clearer than the tome\r","of his land's tongue, which he would oft forsake\r","for nature's pages glass'd by sunbeams on the lake\r","like the chaldean, he could watch the stars,\r","till he had peopled them with beings bright\r","as their own beams; and earth, and earth-born jars,\r","and human frailties, were forgotten quite:\r","could he have kept his spirit to that flight\r","he had been happy; but this clay will sink\r","its spark immortal, envying it the light\r","to which it mounts, as if to break the link\r","that keeps us from yon heaven which woos us to its brink\r","but in man's dwellings he became a thing\r","restless and worn, and stern and wearisome,\r","droop'd as a wild-born falcon with clipt wing,\r","to whom the boundless air alone were home:\r","then came his fit again, which to o'ercome,\r","as eagerly the barr'd-up bird will beat\r","his breast and beak against his wiry dome\r","till the blood tinge his plumage, so the heat\r","of his impeded soul would through his bosom eat\r","     \r","self-exiled harold wanders forth again,\r","with nought of hope left, but with less of gloom;\r","the very knowledge that he lived in vain,\r","that all was over on this side the tomb,\r","had made despair a smilingness assume,\r","which, though 'twer wild,--as on the plundered wreck\r","when mariners would madly meet their doom\r","with draughts intemperate on the sinking deck,--\r","did yet inspire a cheer, which he forbore to check\r","stop!--for thy tread is on an empire's dust!\r","an

was before, thus let it be;--\r","how that red rain hath made the harvest grow!\r","and is this all the world has gained by thee\r","thou first and last of fields! king-making victory?\r","and harold stands upon this place of skulls,\r","the grave of france, the deadly waterloo!\r","how in an hour the power which gave annuls\r","its gifts, transferring fame as fleeting too!\r","in 'pride of place' here last the eagle flew,\r","then tore with bloody talon the rent plain,\r","pierced by the shaft of banded nations through;\r","ambition's life and labours all were vain;\r","he wears the shattered

millions: all tha tmost endears\r","glory, is when the myrtle wreathes a sword\r","such as harmodius drew on athen's tyrant lord\r","there was a sound of revelry by night,\r","and belgium's capital had gathered then\r","her beauty and her chivalry, and bright\r","the lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men;\r","a thousand hearts beat happily; and when\r","music arose with its voluptuous swell,\r","soft eyes look'd love to eyes which spake again,\r","and all went merry as a marriage-bell;\r","but hush! hark! a deep sound strikes like a rising knell!\r","did ye not hear it?--no; 'twas but the wind,\r","or the car rattling o'er the stony stret;\r","on with the dance! let joy e unconfined;\r","no sleep till morn, when youth and pleasure meet\r","to chase the glowing hours with flying feet--\r","but, hark!--that heavy sound breaks in once more,\r","as if the clouds its echo would repeat;\r","and nearer, clearer, deadlier than before!\r","arm! arm! and out--it is--the cannon's opening roar!\r","within a windowed niche of that high hall\r","sate brunswick's fated chieftain; he did hear\r","that sound the first amidst the festival,\r","and caught its tone with death's prophetic ear;\r","and when they smiled because he deem'd it near,\r","     \r","his heart more turly knew hat peal too well\r","which stretch'd his father on a bloody bier,\r","and roused the vengeance blood alone could quell:\r","he rush'd into the field, and, foremost fighting, fell\r","ah! then and there was hurrying to and fro,\r","and gathering tears, and tremblings of distress,\r","and cheeks all pale, which but an hour ago\r","blush'd at the priase of their own loveliness;\r","and there were sudden partings, such as press\r","the life from out young hearts, and choking sighs\r","which ne'er might be repeated; who could guess\r","if ever more should meet those mutual eyes,\r","since upon nights so sweet such awful morn could rise?\r","and there was mounting in hot haste: the steed,\r","the mustering squadron, and the clattering car,\r","went pouring forward in impetuous speed,\r","and swiftly forming in the ranks of war;\r","and the deep thunder peal on peal afar;\r","and near, the beat of the alarming drum\r","roused up the soldier ere the morning star;\r","while throng'd the citizens with terror dumb,\r","or whispering, with white lips--'the foe! they come! they come!'\r","and wild and high the 'cameron's gathering' rose!\r","the war-note of lochiel, which albyn's hills\r","have heard, and heard, too, have her saxon foes:--\r","how in the noon of night that pibroch thrills,\r","savage and shrill! but with the breath which fills\r","their mountain-pipe, so fill the mountaineers\r","with the fierce native daring which instils\r","the stirring memory of a thousand years,\r","and evan's, donald's fame rings in each clansman's ears!\r","and ardennes waves above them her green leaves,\r","dewy with nature's tear-drops, as they pass,\r","grieving, if aught inanimate e'er grieves,\r","            \r","over the unreturning brave,--alas!\r","ere evening to be trodden like the grass\r","which now beneath them, but above shall grow\r","in its next verdure, when this fiery mass\r","of living valour, rolling on the foe\r","and burning with high hope, shall moulder cold and low\r","last noon beheld them full of lusty life,\r","last eve in beauty's circle proudly gay,\r","the midnight brought the signal-sound of strife,\r","the morn the marshalling in arms,--the day\r","battle's magnificently-stern array!\r","the thunder-clouds close o'er it, which when rent\r","the earth is covered thick with other clay,\r","which her own clay shall cover, heaped and pent,\r","rider and horse,--friend, foe,--in one red burial blent!\r","their praise is hymn'd by loftier harps than mine;\r","yet one i would select from that proud throng,\r","partly because they blend me with his line,\r","and partly that i did his sire some wrong,\r","and partly that bright names will hallow song;\r","and his was of the bravest, and when shower'd\r","the death-bolts deadliest the thinn'd files along,\r","even where the thickest of war's tempest lower'd,\r","they reach'd no nobler breast than thine, young, gallant howard!\r","there have been tears and breaking hearts for thee,\r","and mine were nothing, had i such to give;\r","but when i stood beneath the fresh green tree,\r","which living waves where thou didst cease to live,\r","and saw around me the wide field revive\r","with fruits and fertile promise, and the spring\r","come forth her work of gladness to contrive,\r","with all her reckless birds upon the wing,\r","i turn'd from all she brought to those she could not bring\r","i turn'd to thee, to thousands, of whom each\r","            \r","and one as all a ghastly gap did make\r","in his own kind and kindred, whom to teach\r","forgetfulness were mercy for their sake;\r","the archangel's

assumes a stronger, bitterer claim\r","they mourn, but smile at length; and, smiling, mourn:\r","the tree will wither long before it fall;\r","the hull drives on, though mast and sail be torn;\r","the roof-tree sinks, but moulders on the hall\r","in massy hoariness; the ruined wall\r","stands when its wind-worn batlements are gone;\r","the bars survive the captive they enthral;\r","the day drags through though storms keep out the sun;\r","and thus the heart will break, yet brokenly live on:\r","even as a broken mirrow, which the glass\r","in every fragment multiplies; and makes\r","a thousand images of one that was,\r","the same, and still the more, the more it breaks;\r","and thus the heart will do which not forsakes,\r","living in shattered guise, and still, and cold,\r","and bloodless, with its sleepless sorrow aches,\r","yet withers on till all without is old,\r","shewing no visible sign, for such things are untold\r","there is a very life in our despair,\r","vitality of poison,--a quick root\r","which feeds these deadly brances; for it were\r","as nothing did we die; but life will suit\r","itself to sorrow's most detested fruit,\r","like to the apples on the dead sea's shore,\r","all ashes to the taste: did man compute\r","existence by enjoyment, and count o'er\r","such hours 'gainst years of life,--says, would he name three-score?\r","               \r","the psalmist numbered out the years of man:\r","they are enough; and if thy tale be true,\r","thou, who didst grudge him even that fleeting span,\r","more than enough, thoufatal waterloo!\r","millions of tongues record thee, and anew\r","their children's lips shall echo them, and say--\r","'here, where the sword united nations drew,\r","our countrymen were warring on that day!'\r","and this is much, and all which will not pass away\r","there sunk the greatest, nor the worst of men,\r","whose spirit antithetically mixt\r","one moment of the mightiest, and again\r","on little objects with like firmness fixt,\r","extreme in all things! hadst thou been betwixt,\r","thy throne had still been thine, or never been;\r","for daring made thy rise as fall: thou seek'st\r","even now to re-assume the imperial mien,\r","and shake the world, the thunderer of the scene!\r","conqueror and captive of the earth art thou!\r","she trembles at thee still, and thy wild name\r","was ne'er more bruited in men's minds than now\r","that thou art nothing, save the jest of fame,\r","who wooed thee once, thy vassal, and became\r","the flatterer of thy fierceness, till thou wert\r","a god unto thyself; nor less the same\r","to the astounded kingdoms all inert,\r","who deem'd thee for a time whate'er thou didst assert\r","oh, more or less than man--in high or low,\r","battling with nations, flying from the field;\r","now making monarchs' necks thy footstool, now\r","more than thy meanest soldier taught to yield;\r","an empire thou couldst crush, command, rebuild,\r","but govern not thy pettiest passion, nor,\r","however deeply in men's spirits skill'd,\r","look through thine own, nor curb the lust of war,\r","  \r","nor learn that tempted fate will leave the loftiest star\r","yet well thy sould hath brook'd the turning tide\r","with that untaught innate philosophy,\r","which, be it wisdom, coldness, or deep pride,\r","is gall and wormwood to an enemy\r","when the whole host of hatred stood hard by,\r","to watch and mock thee shrinking, thou hast smiled\r","with a sedate and all-enduring eye;--\r","when fortune fled her spoil'd and favourite child,\r","he stood unbowed beneath the ills upon him piled\r","sager than in thy fortunes; for in them\r","ambition steel'd thee on too far to show\r","that just habitual scorn which could contemn\r","men and their thoughts; 'twas wise to feel, not so\r","to wear it ever on thy lip and brow,\r","and spurn the instruments thou wert to use\r","till they were turn'd unto thine overthrow:\r","'tis but a worthless world to win or lose;\r","so hath it proved to thee, and all such lot who choose\r","if, like a tower upon a headlong rock,\r","thou hadst been made to stand or fall alone,\r","such scorn of man had help'd to brave the shock;\r","but men's thoughts were the steps which paved thy throne,\r","their admiratio nthy best weapon sone;\r","the part of philip's son was thine, not then\r","unless aside thy purple had been thrown\r","like stern diogenes to mock at men;\r","for sceptred cynics earth were far too wide a den\r","but quiet to quick bosoms is a hell,\r","and there had been thy bane; there is a fire\r","and motion of the sould which will not dwell\r","in its own narrow being, but aspire\r","beyond the fitting medium of desire;\r","and, but once kindled, quenchless evermore,\r","     \r","preys upon high adventure, nor can tire\r","of aught but rest; a fever at the core,\r","fatal to him who bears, to all who ever bore\r","this makes the madmen who have made men mad\r","by their contagion; conquerors and kings,\r","founders of sects and systems, to whom add\r","sophists, bards, statesmen, all unquiet things\r","which stir too strongly the soul's secret springs,\r","and are themsees the fools to whose they fool;\r","envied, yet how unenviable! what stings\r","are theirs! one breast laid open were a school\r","which would unteach mankind the lust to shine or rule:\r","their breath is agitation, and their life\r","a storm whereon they ride, to sink at last,\r","and yet so nurs'd and bigotted to strife,\r","that should their days, surviving perils past,\r","melt to calm twilight, they feel overcast\r","with sorrow and supineness, and so die;\r","even as a flame unfed, which runs to waste\r","with its own flickering, or a sword laid by\r","which eats into itself, and rusts ingloriously\r","he who ascends to mountain-tops, shall find\r","the loftiest peaks most wrapt in clouds and snow;\r","he who surpasses or subdues mankind,\r","must look down on the hate of those below\r","though high above the sun of glory glow,\r","and far beneath the earth and ocean ocean spread,\r","round him are icy rocks, and loudly blow\r","contending tempests on his naked head,\r","and thus reward the toils which to those summits led\r","away with these! true wisdom's world will be\r","within its own creation, or in thine,\r","maternal nature! for who teems like thee,\r","thus on the banks of thy majestic rhine?\r","  \r","there harold gazes on a work divine,\r","a blending of all beauties; streams and dells,\r","fruit, foilage, crag, wood, cornfield, mountain, vine,\r","and chiefless castles breathing stern farewells\r","from gray but leafy walls, where ruin greenly dwells\r","and there they stand, as stands a lofty mind,\r","worn, but unstooping to the baser crowd,\r","all tenantless, save to the crannying wind,\r","or holding dark communion with the cloud\r","there was a day when they were young and proud,\r","banners on high, and battles pass'd below;\r","but they who fought are in a bloody shroud,\r","and those which waved are shredless dust ere now,\r","and the bleak battlements shall bear no future blow\r","beneath these battlements, within those walls,\r","power dwelt amidst her passions; in proud state\r","each robber chief upheld his armed halls,\r","doing his evil will, nor less elate\r","than mightier heroes of a longer date\r","what want these outlaws conquerors should have\r","but history's purchased page to call them great?\r","a wider space, an ornamented grave?\r","their hopes were not less warm, their souls were full as brave\r","in their baronial feuds and single fields,\r","what deed of prowess unrecorded died!\r","and love, which lent a blazon to their shields,\r","with emblems well devised by amorous pride,\r","through all the mail of iron hearts would glide;\r","but still their flame was fierceness, and drew on\r","keen contest and destruction near allied,\r","and many a tower for some fair mischief won,\r","saw the discoloured rhine beneath its ruin run\r","but thou, exulting and abounding river!\r","making thy waves a blessing as they flow\r","           \r","through banks whose beauty would endure for ever\r","could man but leave thy bright creation so,\r","nor its fair promise from the surface mow\r","with the sharp scythe of conflict,--then to see\r","thy valley of sweet waters, were to know\r","earth paved like heaven; and to seem such to me\r","even now what wants thy stream?--that it should lethe be\r","a thousand battles have assail'd thy banks,\r","but these and half their fame have pass'd away,\r","and slaughter heap'd on high his weltering ranks;\r","their very graves are gone, band what are they?\r","thy tide wash'd down the blood of yesterday,\r","and all was stainless, and on thy clear stream\r","glass'd with its dancing light the sunny ray;\r","but o'er the blackened memory's blighting dream\r","thy waves would vainly roll, all sweeping as they seem\r","thus harold inly said, and pass'd along,\r","yet not insensibly to all which here\r","awoke the jocund birds to early song\r","in glens which might have made even exile dear:\r","though on his brow were graven lines austere,\r","and tranquil sternnes which had ta'en the place\r","of feelings fierier far but less severe,\r","joy was not always absent from his face,\r","but o'er it in such scenes would steal with transient trace\r","nor was all love shut from him, though his days\r","of passion had consumed themsees to dust\r","it is in vain that we would coldly gaze\r","on such as smile upon us; the heart must\r","leak kindly back to kindness, though disgust\r","hath wean'd it from all worldlings: thus he felt,\r","for there was soft remembrance, and sweet trust\r","in one fond breast, to which his own would melt,\r","and in its tenderer hour on that his bosom dwelt\r","        \r","and he had learn'd to love,--i know not why,\r","for this in such as him seems strange of mood,--\r","the helpless looks of blooming infancy,\r","even in its earliest nurture; what subdued,\r","to change like this, a mind so far imbued\r","with scorn of man, it little boots to know;\r","but thus it was; and though in solitude\r","small power the nipp'd affections have to grow,\r","in him this glowed when all beside had ceased to glow\r","and there was one soft breast, as hath been said,\r","which unto his was bound by stronger ties\r","than the church links withal; and, though unwed,\r","that love was pure, and, far above disguise,\r","had stood the test of mortal enmities\r","still undivided, and cemented more\r","by peril, dreaded most in female eyes;\r","but this was firm, and from a foreign shore\r","well to that heart might his these absent greetings pour!\r","the castled crag of drachenfels\r","frowns o'er the wide and winding rhine,\r","whose breast of waters broadly swells\r","between the banks which bear the vine,\r","and hills all rich with blossomed trees,\r","and fields which promise corn and wine,\r","and scattered cities crowning these,\r","whose far white walls along them shine,\r","have strewed a scene, which i should see\r","with double joy were thou with me!\r","and peasant girls, with deep blue eyes,\r","and hand which offer early flowers,\r","walk smiling o'er this paradise\r","above, the frequent feudal towers\r","through green leaves lift their walls of grey,\r","and many a rock which steeply lours,\r","and noble arch in proud decay,\r","look o'er this vale of vintage-bowers;\r","     \r","but one thing want these banks of rhine,--\r","thy gentle hand to clasp in mine!\r","i send the lilies given to me;\r","though long before thy hand they touch,\r","i know that they must withered be,\r","but yet reject them not as such;\r","for i have cherish'd them as dear,\r","because they yet may meet thine eye,\r","and guide thy sould to mine even here,\r","when thou behold'st them drooping night,\r","and knowst them gathered by the rhine,\r","and offered from my heart to thine!\r","the river nobly foams and flows,\r","the charm of this enchanted ground,\r","and all its thousand turns disclose\r","some fresher beauty varying round;\r","the haughtiest breast its wish might bound\r","through life to dwell delighted here;\r","nor could on earth a spot be found\r","to nature and to me so dear,\r","could thy dear eyes in following mine\r","still sweeten more these banks of rhine!\r","by coblentz, on a rise of gentle ground,\r","there is a small and simply pyramid,\r","crowning the summit of the verdant mound;\r","beneath its base are heroes' ashes hid,\r","our enemy's,--but let not that forbid\r","honour to marceau! o'er whose early tomb\r","tears, big tears, gush'd from the rough soldier's lid,\r","lamenting and yet envying such a doom,\r","falling for france, whose rights he battled to resume\r","brief, brave, and glorious was his young career,--\r","his mourners were two hosts, his friends and foes;\r","and fitly may the stranger lingering here\r","  \r","pray for his gallant spirit's bright repose;\r","for he was freedom's champion, one of those,\r","the few in number, who had not o'erstept\r","the charter to chastise which she bestows\r","on such as wield her weapons; he had kept\r","the whiteness of his soul, and thus men o'er him wept\r","here ehrenbreitstein, with her shattered wall\r","black with the miner's blast, upon her height\r","yet shows of what she was, when shell and ball\r","rebounding idly on her strength did light;\r","a tower of victory! from whence the flight\r","of baffled foes was watch'd along the plain:\r","but peace destroy'd what war could never blight,\r","and laid those proud roofs bare to summer's rain--\r","on which the iron shower for years had pour'd in vain\r","adieu to thee, fair rhine! how long delighted\r","the stranger fain would linger on his way!\r","thine is a scene alike where souls united\r","or lonely contemplation thus might stray;\r","and could the ceaseless vultures cease to prey\r","on self-condemning bosoms, it were here,\r","where nature, nor too sombre nor too gay,\r","wild but not rude, awful yet not austere,\r","is to the mellow earth as autumn to the year\r","adieu to thee again! a vain adieu!\r","there can be found no farewell to scene like thine;\r","the mind is coloured by thy every hue;\r","and if reluctantly the eyes resign\r","their cherish'd gaze upon thee, lovely rhine!\r","'tis with the thankful glance of parting praise;\r","more mighty spots may rise--more glaring shine,\r","but none unite in one attaching maze\r","the brilliant, fair, and soft,--the glories of old days,\r","the negligently grand, the fruitful bloom\r","    \r","of coming ripeness, the white city's sheen,\r","the rolling stream, the precipice's gloom,\r","the forest's growth, and gothic's walls between,\r","the wild rocks shaped as they had turrets been\r","in mockery of man's art; and these withal\r","a race of faces happy as the scene,\r","whose fertile bounties extend to all,\r","still sprining o'er thy banks, though empires near them fall\r","but these recede above me are the alps,\r","the palaces of nature, whose vast walls\r","have pinnacled in clouds their snowy scalps,\r","and throned eternity in icy halls\r","of cold sublimity, where forms and falls\r","the avalanche--the thunderbolt of snow!\r","all which expands the spirit, yet appals,\r","gather around these summits, as to show\r","how earth may pierce to heaven, yet leave vain man below\r","but ere these matchless heights i dare to scan,\r","there is a spot should not be pass'd in vain,--\r","morat! the proud, the patriot field! where man\r","may gaze on ghastly trophies of the slain,\r","nor blush for those who conquered on that plain;\r","here burgundy bequeath'd his tombless host,\r","a bony heap, through ages to remain,\r","themsees their monument;--the stygian coast\r","unsepulchred they roam'd, and shriek'd each wandering ghost\r","while waterloo with cannae's carnage vies,\r","morat and marathon twin names shall stand;\r","they were true glory's stainless victories,\r","won by the unambitious heart and hand\r","of a proud, brotherly, and civic band,\r","all unbought champions in no princely cause\r","of vice-entail'd corruption; they no land\r","doom'd to bewail the blasphemy of laws\r","making kings' rights divine, by some draconic clause\r","         \r","by a lone wall a lonelier column rears\r","a gray and grief-worn aspect of old days,\r","'tis the last remnant of the wreck of years,\r","and looks as with the wild-bewildered gaze\r","of one to stone converted by amaze,\r","yet still with consciousness; and there it stands\r","making a marvel that it not decays,\r","when the coeval pride of human hands,\r","levell'd aventicum, hath strewed her subject lands\r","and there--oh! sweet and sacred be the name!--\r","julia--the daughter, the devoted--gave\r","her youth to heaven; her heart, beneath a claim\r","nearest to heaven's, broke o'er a father's grave\r","justice is sworn 'gainst tears, and hers would crave\r","the life she lived in; but the judge was just,\r","and then she died on him she could not save\r","their tomb was simple, and without a bust,\r","and held within their urn one mind, one heart, one dust\r","but these are deeds which should not ass away,\r","and names that must not wither, though the earth\r","forgets her empires with a just decay,\r","the enslavers and the enslaved, their death and birth;\r","the high, the mountain-majesty of worth\r","should be, and shall, survivor of its woe,\r","and from its immortality look forth\r","in the sun's face, like yonder alpine snow;\r","imperishably pure beyond all things below\r","lake leman woos me with its crystal face,\r","the mirror where the stars and mountains view\r","the stillness of their aspect in each trace\r","its clear depth yields of their far height and hue:\r","there is too much of man here, to look through\r","with a fit mindt he might which i behold;\r","but soon in me shall loneliness renew\r","thoughts hid, but not less cherish'd than of old,\r","    \r","ere mingling with the herd had penn'd me in their fold\r","to fly from, need not be to hate, mankind;\r","all are not fit with them to stire and toil,\r","nor is it discontent to keep the mind\r","deep in its fountain, lest it overvoil\r","in the hot throng, where we become the spoil\r","of our infection, till too late and long\r","we may deplore and struggle with the coil,\r","in wretched interchange of wrong for wrong\r","'midst a contentious world, striving where none are strong\r","there, in a moment, we may plunge our years\r","in fatal penitence, and in the blight\r","of our own soul, turn all our blood to tears,\r","and colour things to come with hues of night;\r","the race of life becomes a hopeless flight\r","to those that walk in darkness: on the sea,\r","the boldest steer but where their ports invite,\r","but there are wanderers o'er eternity\r","whose bark drives on and one, and anchored ne'er shall be\r","is it not better, then, to be alone,\r","and love earth only for its earthly sake?\r","by the blue rushing of the arrowy rhone,\r","or the pure bosom of its nursing lake,\r","which feeds it as a mother who doth make\r","a fair but froward infant her own care,\r","kissing its cries away as these awake;--\r","is it not better thus our lives to wear,\r","than join the crushing crowd, doom'd to inflict or bear?\r","i live not in myself, but i become\r","portion of that around me; and to me\r","high mountains are a feeling, but the hum\r","of human cities torture: i can see\r","nothing to loathe in nature, save to be\r","a link reluctant in a fleshly chain,\r","       \r","class'd among creatures, when the soul can flee,\r","and with the sky, the peak, the heaving plain\r","of ocean, or the stars, mingle, and not in vain\r","and thus i am absorb'd, and this is life:\r","i look upon the peopled desart past,\r","as on a place of agony and strife,\r","where, for some sin, to sorrow i was cast,\r","to act and suffer, but remount at last\r","with a fresh pinion; which i feel to spring,\r","though young, yet waxing vigorous, as the blast\r","which it would cope with, on delighted wing,\r","spurning the clay-cold bonds with round our being cling\r","and when, at length, the mind shall all be free\r","from what it hates in this degraded form,\r","reft of its carnal life, save what shall be\r","existent happier in the fly and worm,--\r","when elements to elements conform,\r","and dust is as it should be, shall i note\r","feel all i see, less dazzling, but more warm?\r","the bodiless thought? the spirit of each spot?\r","of which, even now, i share at times the immortal lot?\r","are not the mountains, waves, and skies, a part\r","of me and of my soul, as i of them?\r","is not the love of these deep in my heart\r","with a pure passion? should i not contemn\r","all objects, if compared with these? and stem\r","a tide of suffering, rather than forego\r","such feelings for the hard and worldly phlegm\r","of those whose eyes are only turn'd below,\r","gazing upon the ground, with thoughts which dare not glow?\r","but this is not my theme; and i return\r","to that which is immediate, and require\r","those who find contemplation in the urn,\r","to look on one, whose dust was once all fire,\r","      \r","a native of the land where i respire\r","the clear air for a while--a passing guest,\r","where he became a being,--whose desire\r","was to be glorious; 'twas a foolish quest,\r","the which to gain and keep, he sacrificied all rest\r","here the self-torturing sophist, wild rousseau,\r","the apostle of affliction, he who threw\r","enchantment over passion, and from woe\r","wrung overwhelming eloquence, first drew\r","the breath which made him wretched; yet he knew\r","how to make madness beautiful, and cast\r","o'er erring deeds and thoughts, a heavenly hue\r","of words, like sunbeams, dazzling as they past\r","the eyes, which o'er them shed tears feelingly and fast\r","his love was passion's essence--as a tree\r","on fire by lightning; with ethereal flame\r","kindled he was, and blasted; for to be\r","thus, and enamoured, were in him the same\r","but his was not the love of living dame,\r","nor of the dead who rise upon our dreams\r","but of ideal beauty, which became\r","in him existence, and o'erflowering teems\r","along his burning page, distempered though it seems\r","this breathed itself to life in julie, this\r","invested her with all that's wild and sweet;\r","this hallowed, too, the memorable kiss\r","which every morn his fevered lip would greet,\r","from hers, who but with friendship his would meet;\r","but to that gentle touch, through brain and breast\r","flash'd the thrill'd spirit's love-devouring heat;\r","in that absorbing sigh perchance more blest,\r","than vulgar minds may be with all they seek possest\r","his life was one long war with self-sought foes,\r","or friends by him self-banish'd; for his mind\r","    \r","had grown suspicion's sanctuary, and chose\r","for its own cruel sacrifice, the kind,\r","'gainst whom he raged with fury strange and blind\r","but he was phrenzied,--wherefore, who may know?\r","since cause might be which skill could never find;\r","but he was phrenzied by disease or woe,\r","to that worst pitch of all, which wears a reasoning show\r","for then he was inspired, and from him came,\r","as from the pythian's mystic cave of your,\r","those oracles which set the world in flame,\r","nor ceased to burn till kingdoms were no more:\r","did he not this for france? which lay before\r","bowed to the inborn tyranny of years?\r","broken and trembling, to the yoke she bore,\r","till by the voice of him and his compeers,\r","roused up too much wrath which follows o'ergrown fears?\r","they made themsees a fearful monument!\r","the wreck of old opinions--things which grew\r","breathed from the birth of time: the veil they rent,\r","and what behind it lay, all earth shall view\r","but good with ill they also overthrew,\r","leaving but ruins, wherewith to rebuild\r","upon the same foundation, and renew\r","dungeons and thrones, which the same hour re-fill'd,\r","as heretofore, because ambitio was self-will'd\r","but this will not endure, nor be endured!\r","mankind have felt their strength, and made it felt\r","they might have used it better, but, allured\r","by their new vigour, sternly have they dealt\r","on one another; pity ceased to melt\r","with her once natural charities but they,\r","who in oppression's darkness caved had dwelt,\r","they were not eagles, nourish'd with the day;\r","what marvel then, at times, if they mistook their prey?\r","     \r","what deep wounds ever closed without a scar?\r","the heart's bleed longest, and but heal to wear\r","that which disfigures it; and they who war\r","with their own hopes, and have been vanquish'd, bear\r","silence, but not submission: in his lair\r","fix'd passion holds his breath, until the hour\r","which shall atone for years; none need despair:\r","it came, it cometh, and will come,--the power\r","to punish or forgive--in one we shall be slower\r","clear, placid leman! thy contrasted lake,\r","with the wild world i dwelt in, is a thing\r","which warns me, with its stillness, to forsake\r","earth's troubled waters for a purer spring\r","this quiet sail is as a noiseless wing\r","to waft me from distraction; once i loved\r","torn ocean's roar, but thy soft murmuring\r","sounds sweet as if a sister's voice reproved,\r","that i with stern delights should e'er have been so moved\r","it is the hush of night, and all between\r","thy margin and the mountains, dusk, yet clear,\r","mellowed and mingling, yet distinctly seen,\r","save darken'd jura, whose capt heights appear\r","precipitously steep; and drawing near,\r","there breathes a living fragrance from the shore,\r","of flowers yet fresh with childhood; on the ear\r","drops the light drip of the suspended oar,\r","or chirps the grasshopped one good-night carol more;\r","he is an evening reveller, who makes\r","his life an infancy, and sings his fill;\r","at intervals, some bird from out the brakes,\r","starts into voice a moment, then is still\r","there seems a floating whisper on the hill,\r","but that is fancy, for the starlight dews\r","all silently their tears of love instil,\r","weeping themsees away, till they infuse\r","deep into nature's breast the spirit of her hues\r","      \r","ye stars! which are the poetry of heaven!\r","if in your bright leaves we would read the fate\r","of men and empires,--'tis to be forgiven,\r","that in our aspirations to be great,\r","our destinies o'erleap their mortal state,\r","and claim a kindred with you; for ye are\r","a beauty and a mystery, and create\r","in us such love and reverence from afar,\r","that fortune, fame, power, life, have named themsees a star\r","all heaven and earth are still--though not in sleep,\r","but breathless, as we grow when feeling most;\r","and silent, as we stand in thoughts too deep:--\r","all heaven and earth are still: from the high host\r","of stars, to the lull'd lake and mountain-coast,\r","all is concentered in a life intense,\r","where not a beam, nor air, nor leaf is lost,\r","but hath a part of beings, and a sense\r","of that which is of all creator and defence\r","x\r","then stirs the feeling infinite, so felt\r","in solitude, where we are least alone;\r","a truth, which through our being then doth melt\r","and purifies from self: it is a tone,\r","the soul and source of music, which makes known\r","eternal harmony, and sheds a charm,\r","like to the fabled cytherea's zone,\r","binding all things with beauty;--'twould disarm\r","the spectre death, had he substantial power to harm\r","not vainly did the early persian make\r","his altar the high places and the peak\r","of earth-o'ergazing mountains, and thus take\r","a fit and unwall'd temple, there to seek\r","the spirit, in whose honour shrines are weak,\r","uprear'd of human hands come, and compare\r","columns and idol-dwellings, goth or greek,\r","          \r","with nature's realms of worship, earth and air,\r","nor fix on fond abodes to circumscribe thy prayer!\r","x\r","the sky is changed!--and such a change! oh night,\r","and storm, and darkness, ye are wondrous strong,\r","yet lovely in your strength, as is the light\r","of a dark eye in woman! far along,\r","from peak to peak, the rattling crags among\r","leaps the live thunder! not from one lone cloud,\r","but every mountain now hath found a tongue,\r","and jura answers, through her misty shroud,\r","back to the joyous alps, who call to her aloud!\r","and this is in the night:--most glorious night!\r","thou wert not sent for slumber! let me be\r","a sharer in thy fierce and far delight,--\r","a portion of the tempest and of thee!\r","how the lit lake shines, a phosphoric sea,\r","and the big rain comes dancing to the earth!\r","and now again 'tis black,--and now, the glee\r","of the loud hills shakes with its mountain-mirth,\r","as if they did rejoice o'er a young earthquake's birth\r","x\r","now, where the swift rhone cleaves his way between\r","heights which appear as lovers who have parted\r","in hate, whose mining depths so intervene,\r","that they can meet no more, though broken-hearted;\r","though in their souls, which thus each other thwarted,\r","love was the very root of the fond rage\r","which blighted their life's bloom, and then departed:--\r","itself expired, but leaving them an age\r","of years all winters,--war within themsees to wage\r","xcv\r","now, where the quick rhone thus hath cleft his way,\r","the mightiest of the storms hath ta'en his stand:\r","for here, not one, but many, make their play,\r","and fling their thunder-bolts from hand to hand,\r","flashinig and cast around: of all the band,\r","   \r","the brightest throught these parted hills hath fork'd\r","his lightnings,--as if he did understand,\r","that in such gaps as desolation work'd,\r","there the hot shaft should blast whatever therein lurk'd\r","sky, mountains, river, winds, lake, lightnings! ye!\r","with night, and clouds, and thunder, and a soul\r","to make these felt and feeling, well may be\r","things that have made me watchful; the far rool\r","of your departing voices, is the knoll\r","of what in me is sleepless,--if i rest\r","but where of ye, oh tempests! is the goal?\r","are ye like those within the human breast?\r","or do ye find, at length, like eagles, some high nest?\r","xcv\r","could i embody and unbosom now\r","that which is most within me,--could i wreak\r","my thoughts upon expression, and thus throw\r","soul, heart, mind, passions, feelings, strong or weak,\r","all that i would have sought, and all i seek,\r","bear, know, feel, and yet breath--into one word,\r","and that one word were lightning, i would speak;\r","but as it is, i live and die unheard,\r","with a most voiceless thought, sheathing it as a sword\r","the morn is up again, the dewy morn,\r","with breath all incense, and with cheek all bloom,\r","laughing the clouds away with playful scorn,\r","and living as if earth contain'd no tomb,--\r","and glowing into day: we may resume\r","the march of our existence: and thus i,\r","still on thy shores, fair leman! may find room\r","and food for meditation, nor pass by\r","much, that may give us pause, if pondered fittingly\r","clarens! sweet clarens, birth-place of deep love!\r","thine air is the young breath of passionate thought;\r","thy trees take root in love; the snows above\r","     \r","the very glaciers have his colours caught,\r","and sun-set into rose-hues sees them wrought\r","by rays which sleep there lovingly: the rocks,\r","the permanent crags, tell here of love, who sought\r","in them a refuge from the worldly shocks,\r","which stir and sting the soul with hope that woos, then mocks\r","clarens! by heavenly feet thy paths are trod,--\r","undying love's who here ascends a throne\r","to which the steps are mountains; where the god\r","is a pervading life and light,--so shown\r","not on those summits solely, nor alone\r","in the still cave and forest: o'er the flower\r","his eye is sparkling, and his breath hath blown,\r","his soft and summer breath, whose tender power\r","passes the strength of storms in their most desolate hour\r","ci\r","all things are here of him; from the black pines,\r","which are his shade on high, and the loud roar\r","of torrents, where he listeneth, to the vines\r","which slope his green path downward to the shore,\r","where the bowed waters meet him, and adore,\r","kissing his feet with murmurs; and the wood,\r","the covert of old trees, with trunks all hoar,\r","but light leaves, young as joy, stands were it stood,\r","offering to him, and his, a populous solitude,\r","a populous solitude of bees and birds,\r","and fairy form'd and many coloured things,\r","who worship him with notes more sweet than words,\r","and innocently open their glad wings,\r","fearless and full of life: the gush of springs,\r","and fall of lofty fountains, and the bend\r","of stirring brances, and the bud which brings\r","the swiftest thought of beauty, here extend,\r","mingling, and made by love, unto one mighty end\r","ci\r","he who hath loved not, here would learn that lore,\r","          \r","and make his heart a spirit; he who knows\r","that tender mystery, will love the more,\r","for this is love's recess, where vain men's woes,\r","and the world's waste, have driven him far from those,\r","for 'tis his nature to advance or die;\r","he stands not still, but or decays, or grows\r","into a boundless blessing, which may vie\r","with the immortal lights, in its eternity!\r","'twas not for fiction chose rousseau this spot,\r","peopling it with affections; but he found\r","it was the scene which passio nmust allot\r","to the mind's purifed beings; 'twas the ground\r","where early love his psyche's zone unbound,\r","and hallowed it with loveliness: 'tis ne,\r","and wonderful, and deep, and hath a sound,\r","and sense, and sight of sweetness; here the rhone\r","hath spread himself a couch, the alps have rear'd a throne\r","cv\r","lausanne! and ferney! ye have been the abodes\r","of names which unto you bequeath'd a name;\r","mortals, who sought and found, by dangerous roads,\r","a path to perpetuity of fame:\r","they were gigantic minds, and their steep aim,\r","was, titan-like, on daring doubts to pile\r","thoughts which should call down thunder, and the flame\r","of heaven, again assail'd, if heaven the while\r","on man and man's research could deign to more than smile\r","cvi\r","the one was fire and fickleness, a child,\r","most mutable in wishes, but in mind,\r","a wit as various,--gay, grave, sage, or wild,--\r","historian, board, philosopher,

penalty is paid;\r","it is not ours to judge,--far less condemn;\r","the hour must come when such things shall be made\r","known unto all,--or hope and dread allay'd\r","by slumber, on one pillow,--in the dust,\r","which, thus much we are sure, must lie decay'd;\r","and when it shall revive, as is our trust,\r","'twill be to be forgiven, or suffer what is just\r","ci\r","but let me quit man's works, again to read\r","his maker's, spread around me, and suspend\r","this page, which from my reveries i feed,\r","until it seems prolonging without end\r","the clouds above me to the white alps tend,\r","and i must pierce them, and survey whate'er\r","may be permitted, as my steps i bend\r","to their most great and growing region, where\r","the earth to her embrace compels the powers of air\r","italia! too, italia! looking on thee,\r","full flashes on the soul the light of ages,\r","since the fierce carthaginian almost won thee,\r","to the last halo of the chiefs and sages,\r","who

from the eternal source of rome's imperial hill\r","cxi\r","thus far i have proceeded in a theme\r","renewed with no kind auspices:--to feel\r","we are not what we have been, and to deem\r","we are not what we should be,--and to steel\r","the heart against itself; and to conceal,\r","with a proud caution, love, or hate, or aught,--\r","passion or feeling, purpose, grief or zeal,--\r","which is the tyrant spirit of our thought,\r","is a stern task of soul:--no matter,--it is taught\r","and for these words, thus woven into song,\r","it may be that they are a harmless wile,--\r","the colouring of the scenes which fleet along,\r","which i would seize, in passing, to beguile\r","my breast, or that of others, for a while\r","fame is the thirst of youth,--but i am not\r","so young as to regard men's frown or smile,\r","as loss or guerdon of a glorious lot;\r","i stood and stand alone,--remembered or forgot\r","cxi\r","i have not loved the world, nor the world me;\r","i have not flattered its rank breath, nor bow'd\r","to its idolatries a patient knee,--\r","nor coin'd my cheek to smiles,--nor cried aloud\r","in worship of an echo; in the crowd\r","they could not deem me one of such; i stood\r","among them, but not of them; in a shroud\r","of thoughts which were not their thoughts, and still could,\r","had i not filed my mind, which thus itself subdued\r","i have not loved the world, nor the world me,--\r","but let us part fair foes; i do believe,\r","though i have found them not, that there may be\r","words which are things,--hopes which will not deceive,\r","and virtues

chance\r","that bridegrooms, after they are fairly groom'd,\r","may retrograde a little in the dance\r","of marriage which might form a painter's fame,\r","like holbein's 'dance of death'--but 'tis the same;--\r","but adeline determined juan's wedding\r","in her own mind, and that 's enough for woman:\r","but then, with whom? there was the sage miss reading,\r","miss raw, miss flaw, miss showman, and miss knowman\r","and the two fair co-heiresses giltbedding\r","she deem'd his merits something more than common:\r","all these were unobjectionable matches,\r","and might go on, if well

class,--\r","aurora raby, a young star who shone\r","o'er life, too sweet an image for such glass,\r","a lovely being, scarcely form'd or moulded,\r","a rose with all its sweetest leaves yet folded;\r","rich, noble, but an orphan; left an only\r","child to the care of guardians good and kind;\r","but still her aspect had an air so lonely!\r","blood is not water; and where shall we find\r","feelings of youth like those which overthrown lie\r","by death, when we are left, alas! behind,\r","to feel, in friendless palaces, a home\r","is wanting, and our best ties in the tomb?\r","early in years, and yet more infantine\r","in figure, she had something of sublime\r","in eyes which sadly shone, as seraphs' shine\r","all youthbut with an aspect beyond time;\r","radiant and graveas pitying man's decline;\r","mournfulbut mournful of another's crime,\r","she look'd as if she sat by eden's door\r","and grieved for those who could return no more\r","she was a catholic, too, sincere, austere,\r","as far as her own gentle heart allow'd,\r","and deem'd that fallen worship far more dear\r","perhaps because 'twas fallen: her sires were proud\r","of deeds and days when they had fill'd the ear\r","of nations, and had never bent or bow'd\r","to novel power; and as she was the last,\r","she held their old faith and old feelings fast\r","she gazed upon a world she scarcely knew,\r","as seeking not to know it; silent, lone,\r","as grows a flower, thus quietly she grew,\r","     \r","and kept her heart serene within its zone\r","there was awe in the homage which she drew;\r","her spirit seem'd as seated on a throne\r","apart from the surrounding world, and strong\r","in its own strengthmost strange in one so young!\r","now it so happen'd, in the catalogue\r","of adeline, aurora was omitted,\r","although her birth and wealth had given her vogue\r","beyond the charmers we have already cited;\r","her beauty also seem'd to form no clog\r","against her being mention'd as well fitted,\r","by many virtues, to be worth the trouble\r","of single gentlemen who would be double\r","and this omission, like that of the bust\r","of brutus at the pageant of tiberius,\r","made juan wonder, as no doubt he must\r","this he express'd half smiling and half serious;\r","when adeline replied with some disgust,\r","and with an air, to say the least, imperious,\r","she marvell'd 'what he saw in such a baby\r","as that prim, silent, cold aurora raby?'\r","juan rejoin'd'she was a catholic,\r","and therefore fittest, as of his persuasion;\r","since he was sure his mother would fall sick,\r","and the pope thunder excommunication,\r","if--' but here adeline, who seem'd to pique\r","herself extremely on the inoculation\r","of others with her own opinions, stated--\r","as usual--the same reason which she late did\r","and wherefore not? a reasonable reason,\r","if good, is none the worse for repetition;\r","if bad, the best way's certainly to tease on,\r","and amplify: you lose much by concision,\r","whereas insisting in or out of season\r","convinces all men, even a politician;\r","orwhat is just the sameit wearies out\r","so the end's gain'd, what signifies the route?\r","why adeline had this slight prejudice -\r","for prejudice it wasagainst a creature\r","as pure as sanctity itself from vice,\r","with all the added charm of form and feature,\r","for me appears a question far too nice,\r","since adeline was liberal by nature;\r","but nature's nature, and has more caprices\r","than i have time, or will, to take to pieces\r","perhaps she did not like the quiet way\r","with which aurora on those baubles look'd,\r","which charm most people in their earlier day:\r","for there are few things by mankind less brook'd,\r","and womankind too, if we so may say,\r","than finding thus their genius stand rebuked,\r","like 'anthony's by caesar,' by the few\r","who look upon them as they ought to do\r","it was not envyadeline had none;\r","her place was far beyond it, and her mind\r","it was not scornwhich could not light on one\r","whose greatest fault was leaving few to find\r","it was not jealousy, i think: but shun\r","following the 'ignes fatui' of mankind\r","it was notbut 'tis easier far, alas!\r","to say what it was not than what it was\r","little aurora deem'd she was the theme\r","of such discussion she was there a guest;\r","a beauteous ripple of the brilliant stream\r","of rank and youth, though purer than the rest,\r","which flow'd on for a moment in the beam\r","time sheds a moment o'er each sparkling crest\r","had she known this, she would have calmly smiled--\r","she had so much, or little, of the child\r","the dashing and proud air of adeline\r","imposed not upon her: she saw her blaze\r","much as she would have seen a glow -worm shine,\r","then turn'd unto the stars for loftier rays\r","juan was something she could not divine,\r","being no sibyl in the new world's ways;\r","     \r","yet she was nothing dazzled by the meteor,\r","because she did not pin her faith on feature\r","his fame too,--for he had that kind of fame\r","which sometimes plays the deuce with womankind,\r","a heterogeneous mass of glorious blame,\r","half virtues and whole vices being combined;\r","faults which attract because they are not tame;\r","follies trick'd out so brightly that they blind:--\r","these seals upon her wax made no impression,\r","such was her coldness or her self-possession\r","juan knew nought of such a character--\r","high, yet resembling not his lost haidee;\r","yet each was radiant in her proper sphere:\r","the island girl, bred up by the lone sea,\r","more warm, as lovely, and not less sincere,\r","was nature's all: aurora could not be,\r","nor would be thus:--the difference in them\r","was such as lies between a flower and gem\r","having wound up with this sublime comparison,\r","methinks we may proceed upon our narrative,\r","and, as my friend scott says, 'i sound my warison;'\r","scott, the superlative of my comparative--\r","scott, who can paint your christian knight or saracen,\r","serf, lord, man, with such skill as none would share it, if\r","there had not been one shakspeare and voltaire,\r","of one or both of whom he seems the heir\r","i say, in my slight way i may proceed\r","to play upon the surface of humanity\r","i write the world, nor care if the world read,\r","at least for this i cannot spare its vanity\r","my muse hath bred, and still perhaps may breed\r","more foes by this same scroll: when i began it, i\r","thought that it might turn out sonow i know it,\r","but still i am, or was, a pretty poet\r","the conference or congress for it ended\r","as congresses of late do of the lady\r","adeline and don

hour, call'd half-hour, given to dress,\r","though ladies' robes seem scant enough for less\r","great things were now to be achieved at table,\r","with massy plate for armour, knives and forks\r","for weapons; but what muse since homer 's able\r","his feasts are not the worst part of his works\r","to draw up in array a single day-bill\r","of modern dinners? where more mystery lurks,\r","in soups or sauces, or a sole ragout,\r","there was a goodly 'soupe a la bonne femme,'\r","though god knows whence it came from; there was, too,\r","a turbot for relief of those who cram,\r","relieved with 'dindon a la parigeux;'\r","how shall i get this gourmand stanza through?--\r","'soupe a la beauveau,' whose relief was dory,\r","relieved itself by pork, for greater glory\r","but i must crowd all into one grand mess\r","or mass; for should i stretch into detail,\r","my muse would run much more into excess,\r","than when some squeamish people deem her frail\r","but though a 'bonne vivante,' i must confess\r","her stomach's not her peccant part; this tale\r","however doth require some slight refection,\r","just to relieve her spirits from dejection\r","fowls 'a la conde,' slices eke of salmon,\r","with 'sauces genevoises,' and haunch of venison;\r","wines too, which might again have slain young ammon--\r","a man like whom i hope we shan't see many soon;\r","they also set a glazed westphalian ham on,\r","whereon apicius would bestow his benison;\r","and then there was champagne with foaming whirls,\r","as white as cleopatra's melted pearls\r","then there was god knows what 'a l'allemande,'\r","'a l'espagnole,' 'timballe,' and 'salpicon'--\r"," \r","with things i can't withstand or understand,\r","though swallow'd with much zest upon the whole;\r","and 'entremets' to piddle

cookery could have call'd forth such resources,\r","as form a science and a nomenclature\r","from out the commonest demands of nature?\r","the glasses jingled, and the palates tingled;\r","the diners of celebrity dined well;\r","the ladies with more moderation mingled\r","in the feast, pecking less than i can tell;\r","also the younger men too: for a springald\r","can't, like ripe age, in

would spoil my liquid lay:\r","but i have dined, and must forego, alas!\r","the chaste description even of a 'becasse;'\r","and fruits, and ice, and all that art refines\r","from nature for the service of the gout--\r","taste or the gout,--pronounce it as inclines\r","your stomach! ere you dine, the french will do;\r","but after, there are sometimes certain signs\r","which prove plain

guests were placed according to their roll,\r","but various as the various meats display'd:\r","don juan sat next 'an l'espagnole'--\r","no damsel, but a dish, as hath been said;\r","but so far like a lady, that 'twas drest\r","superbly, and contain'd a world of zest\r","by some odd chance too, he was placed between\r","aurora and the lady adeline--\r","a situation difficult, i ween,\r","for man therein, with eyes and heart, to dine\r","also the conference which we have seen\r","    \r","was not such as to encourage him to shine;\r","for adeline, addressing few words to him,\r","with two transcendent eyes seem'd to look through him\r","i sometimes almost think that eyes have ears:\r","this much is sure, that, out of earshot, things\r","are somehow echoed to the pretty dears,\r","of which i can't tell whence their knowledge springs\r","like that same mystic music of the spheres,\r","which no one bears, so loudly though it rings,\r","'t is wonderful how oft the sex have heard\r","long dialogueswhich pass'd without a word!\r","aurora sat with that indifference\r","which piques a preux chevalieras it ought:\r","of all offences that's the worst offence,\r","which seems to hint you are not worth a thought\r","now juan, though no coxcomb in pretence,\r","was not exactly pleased to be so caught;\r","like a good ship entangled among ice,\r","and after so much excellent advice\r","to his gay nothings, nothing was replied,\r","or something which was nothing, as urbanity\r","required aurora scarcely look'd aside,\r","nor even smiled enough for any vanity\r","the devil was in the girl! could it be pride?\r","or modesty, or absence, or inanity?\r","heaven knows? but adeline's malicious eyes\r","sparkled with her successful prophecies,\r","and look'd as much as if to say, 'i said it;'\r","a kind of triumph i'll not recommend,\r","because it sometimes, as i have seen or read it,\r","both in the case of lover and of friend,\r","will pique a gentleman, for his own credit,\r","to bring what was a jest to a serious end:\r","for all men prophesy what is or was,\r","and hate those who won't let them come to pass\r","juan was drawn thus into some attentions,\r","slight but select, and just enough to express,\r","  \r","to females of perspicuous comprehensions,\r","that he would rather make them more than less\r","aurora at the last so history mentions,\r","though probably much less a fact than guess\r","so far relax'd her thoughts from their sweet prison,\r","as once or twice to smile, if not to listen\r","from answering she began to question; this\r","with her was rare: and adeline, who as yet\r","thought her predictions went not much amiss,\r","began to dread she'd thaw to a coquette--\r","so very difficult, they say, it is\r","to keep extremes from meeting, when once set\r","in motion; but she here too much refined--\r","aurora's spirit was not of that kind\r","but juan had a sort of winning way,\r","a proud humility, if such there be,\r","which show'd such deference to what females say,\r","as if each charming word were a decree\r","his tact, too, temper'd him from grave to gay,\r","and taught him when to be reserved or free:\r","he had the art of drawing people out,\r","without their seeing what he was about\r","aurora, who in her indifference\r","confounded him in common with the crowd\r","of flatterers, though she deem'd he had more sense\r","than whispering foplings, or than witlings loud--\r","commenced from such slight things will great commence\r","to feel that flattery which attracts the proud\r","rather by deference than compliment,\r","and wins even by a delicate dissent\r","and then he had good looks;--that point was carried\r","nem con amongst the women, which i grieve\r","to say leads oft to crim con with the married -\r","a case which to the juries we may leave,\r","since with digressions we too long have tarried\r","now though we know of old that looks deceive,\r","and always have done, somehow these good looks\r","make more impression than the best of books\r","   \r","aurora, who look'd more on books than faces,\r","was very young, although so very sage,\r","admiring more minerva than the graces,\r","especially upon a printed page\r","but virtue's self, with all her tightest laces,\r","has not the natural stays of strict old age;\r","and socrates, that model of all duty,\r","own'd to a penchant, though discreet, for beauty\r","and girls of sixteen are thus far socratic,\r","but innocently so, as socrates;\r","and really, if the sage sublime and atti\r","at seventy years had phantasies like these,\r","which plato in his dialogues dramati\r","has shown, i know not why they should displease\r","in virginsalways in a modest way,\r","observe; for that with me's a 'sine qua'\r","also observe, that, like the great lord coke\r","see littleton, whene'er i have express'd\r","opinions two, which at first sight may look\r","twin opposites, the second is the best\r","perhaps i have a third, too, in a nook,\r","or none at allwhich seems a sorry jest:\r","but if a writer should be quite consistent,\r","how could he possibly show things existent?\r","if people contradict themsees, can\r","help contradicting them, and every body,\r","even my veracious self?- but that's a lie:\r","i never did so, never will--how should i?\r","he who doubts all things nothing can deny:\r","truth's fountains may be clear--her streams are muddy,\r","and cut through such canals of contradiction,\r","that she must often navigate o'er

entangle\r","myself with metaphysics? none can hate\r","so much as i do any kind of wrangle;\r","and yet, such is my folly, or my fate,\r","i always knock my head against some angle\r","about the present, past, or future state\r","yet i wish well to trojan and to tyrian,\r","for i was bred a moderate presbyterian\r","but though i am a temperate theologian,\r","and also meek as a metaphysician,\r","impartial between tyrian and trojan,\r","as eldon on a lunatic commission--\r","in politics my duty is to show john\r","bull something of the lower world's condition\r","it makes my blood boil like the springs of hecla,\r","to see men let these scoundrel sovereigns break law\r","but politics, and policy, and piety,\r","are topics which i sometimes introduce,\r","not only for the sake of their variety,\r","but as subservient to a moral use;\r","because my business is to dress society,\r","and stuff with sage that very verdant goose\r","and now, that we may furnish with some matter all\r","tastes, we are going to try the supernatural\r","and now i will give up all argument;\r","and positively henceforth no temptation\r","shall 'fool me to the top up of my bent:'--\r","yes, i'll begin a thorough reformation\r","indeed, i never knew what people meant\r","by deeming that my muse's conversation\r","was dangerous;--i think she is as harmless\r","as some who

belief is serious\r","serious? you laugh;--you may: that will i not;\r","my smiles must be sincere or not at all\r","i say i do believe a haunted spot\r","exists--and where? that shall i not

though 'tis by no means my way\r","to rhyme at noonwhen i have other things\r","to think of, if i ever thinki say\r","i feel some chilly midnight shudderings,\r","and prudently postpone, until

full,\r","as most at his age are, of hope and health;\r","yet i must own he looked a little dull,\r","and now and then a tear stole down by stealth;\r","perhaps his recent loss of blood might pull\r","his spirit down; and then the loss of wealth,\r","a mistress, and such comfortable quarters,\r","to be put up for auction amongst tartars,\r","were things to shake a stoic;

guess\r","he was above the vulgar by his mien;\r","and then, though pale, he was so very handsome;\r","and then- they calculated on his ransom\r","  \r","like a backgammon board the place was dotted\r","with whites and blacks, in groups on show for sale,\r","though rather more irregularly spotted:\r","some bought the jet, while others chose the pale\r","it chanced amongst the other people lotted,\r","a man of thirty rather stout and hale,\r","with resolution in his dark grey eye,\r","next juan stood, till some might choose to buy\r","he had an english look; that is, was square\r","in make, of a complexion white and ruddy,\r","good teeth, with curling rather dark brown hair,\r","and, it might be from thought or toil or study,\r","an open brow a little mark'd with care:\r","one arm had on a bandage rather bloody;\r","and there he stood with such sang-froid, that greater\r","could scarce be shown even by a mere spectator\r","but seeing at his elbow a mere lad,\r","of a high spirit evidently, though\r","at present weigh'd down by a doom which had\r","o'erthrown even men, he soon began to show\r","a kind of blunt compassion for the sad\r","lot of so young a partner in the woe,\r","which for himself he seem'd to deem no worse\r","than any other scrape, a thing of course\r","'my boy!' said he, 'amidst this motley crew\r","of georgians, russians, nubians, and what not,\r","all ragamuffins differing but in hue,\r","with whom it is our luck to cast our lot,\r","the only gentlemen seem i and you;\r","so let us be acquainted, as we ought:\r","if i could yield you any consolation,\r","'t would give me pleasure- pray, what is your nation?'\r","when juan answer'd- 'spanish!' he replied,\r","'i thought, in fact, you could not be a greek;\r","those servile dogs are

three?'\r","'no- only two at present above ground:\r","surely 't is nothing wonderful to see\r","one person thrice in holy wedlock bound!'\r","'well, then, your third,' said juan; 'what did she?\r","she did not run away, too,- did she, sir?'\r","'no, faith'- 'what then?'- 'i ran away from her'\r","'you take things coolly, sir,' said juan 'why,'\r","replied the other, 'what can a man do?\r","there still are many rainbows in your sky,\r","but mine have vanish'd all, when life is new,\r","commence with feelings warm, and prospects high;\r","but time strips our illusions of their hue,\r","and one by one in turn, some grand mistake\r","casts off its bright skin yearly like the snake\r","''t is true, it gets another bright and fresh,\r","or fresher, brighter; but the year gone through,\r","this skin must go the way, too, of all flesh,\r","or sometimes only wear a week or two;-\r","love 's the first net which spreads its deadly mesh;\r","ambition, avarice, vengeance, glory,

how\r","it betters present times with me or you'\r","'no?' quoth the other; 'yet you will allow\r","by setting things in their right point of view,\r","knowledge, at least, is gain'd; for instance,

by features\r","are bought up, others by a warlike leader,\r","some by a place- as tend their years or natures;\r","the most by ready cash- but all have prices,\r","from crowns to kicks, according to their vices\r","the eunuch, having eyed them o'er with care,\r","turn'd to the merchant, and begun to bid\r","first but for one, and after for the pair;\r","they haggled, wrangled, swore, too- so they did!\r","as though they were in a mere christian fair\r","cheapening an ox, an ass, a lamb, or kid;\r","so that their bargain sounded like a battle\r","  \r","for this superior yoke of human cattle\r","at last they settled into simple grumbling,\r","and pulling out reluctant purses, and\r","turning each piece of sier o'er, and tumbling\r","some down, and weighing others in their hand,\r","and by mistake sequins with paras jumbling,\r","until the sum was accurately scann'd,\r","and then the merchant giving change, and signing\r","receipts in full, began to think of dining\r","i wonder if his appetite was good?\r","or, if it were, if also his digestion?\r","methinks at meals some odd thoughts might intrude,\r","and conscience ask a curious sort of question,\r","about the right divine how far we should\r","sell flesh and blood when dinner has opprest one,\r","i think it is perhaps the gloomiest hour\r","which turns up out of the sad twenty-four\r","voltaire says 'no:' he tells you that candide\r","found life most tolerable after meals;\r","he 's wrong- unless man were a pig, indeed,\r","repletion rather adds to what he feels,\r","unless he 's drunk, and then no doubt he 's freed\r","from his own brain's oppression while it reels\r","of food i think with philip's son, or rather\r","ammon's ill pleased with one world and one father;\r","i think with alexander, that the act\r","of eating, with another act or two,\r","makes us feel our mortality in fact\r","redoubled; when a roast and a ragout,\r","and fish, and soup, by some side dishes back'd,\r","can give us either pain or pleasure, who\r","would pique himself on intellects, whose use\r","depends so much upon the gastric juice?\r","the other evening 't was on friday last-\r","this is a fact and no poetic fable-\r","just as my great coat was about me cast,\r","my hat and gloves still lying on the table,\r","i heard a shot- 't was eight o'clock scarce past-\r","and, running out as fast as i was able,\r","i found the military commandant\r","stretch'd in the street, and able scarce to pant\r","poor fellow! for some reason, surely bad,\r","they had slain him with five slugs; and left him there\r","to perish on the pavement: so i had\r","him borne into the house and up the stair,\r","and stripp'd and look'd to- but why should i ad\r","more circumstances? vain was every care;\r","the man was gone: in some italian quarrel\r","kill'd by five bullets from an old gun-barrel\r","i gazed upon him, for i knew him well;\r","and though i have seen many corpses, never\r","saw one, whom such an accident befell,\r","so calm; though pierced through stomach, heart, and liver,\r","he seem'd to sleep,- for you could scarcely tell\r","as he bled inwardly, no hideous river\r","of gore divulged the cause that he was dead:\r","so as i gazed on him, i thought or said-\r","'can this be death? then what is life or death?\r","speak!' but he spoke not: 'wake!' but still he slept:-\r","'but yesterday and who had mightier breath?\r","a thousand warriors by his word were kept\r","in awe: he said, as the centurion saith,\r","'go,' and he goeth; 'come,' and forth he stepp'd\r","the trump and bugle till he spake were dumb-\r","and now nought left him but the muffled drum'\r","and they who waited once and worshipp'd- they\r","with their rough faces throng'd about the bed\r","to gaze once more on the commanding clay\r","which for the last, though not the first, time bled:\r","and such an end! that he who many a day\r","had faced napoleon's foes until they fled,-\r","the foremost in the charge or in the sally,\r","should now be butcher'd in a civic alley\r","the scars of his old wounds were near his new,\r","      \r","those honourable scars which brought him fame;\r","and horrid was the contrast to the view-\r","but let me quit the theme; as such things claim\r","perhaps even more attention than is due\r","from me: i gazed as oft i have gazed the same\r","to try if i could wrench aught out of death\r","which should confirm, or shake, or make a faith;\r","but it was all a mystery here we are,\r","and there we go:- but where? five bits of lead,\r","or three, or two, or one, send very far!\r","and is this blood, then, form'd but to be shed?\r","can every element our elements mar?\r","and air- earth- water- fire live- and we dead?\r","we whose minds comprehend all things? no more;\r","but let us to the story as before\r","the purchaser of juan and acquaintance\r","bore off his bargains to a gilded boat,\r","embark'd himself and them, and off they went thence\r","as fast as oars could pull and water float;\r","they look'd like persons being led to sentence,\r","wondering what next, till the caique was brought\r","up in a little creek below a wall\r","o'ertopp'd with cypresses, dark-green and tall\r","here their conductor tapping at the wicket\r","of a small iron door, 't was open'd, and\r","he led them onward, first through a low thicket\r","flank'd by large groves, which tower'd on either hand:\r","they almost lost their way, and had to pick it-\r","for night was dosing ere they came to land\r","the eunuch made a sign to those on board,\r","who row'd off, leaving them without a word\r","as they were plodding on their winding way\r","through orange bowers, and jasmine, and so forth\r","of which i might have a good deal to say,\r","there being no such profusion in the north\r","of oriental plants, 'et cetera,'\r","but that of late your scribblers think it worth\r","their while to rear whole hotbeds in their works\r","  \r","because one poet travell'd 'mongst the turks-\r","as they were threading on their way, there came\r","into don juan's head a thought, which he\r","whisper'd to his companion:- 't was the same\r","which might have then occurr'd to you or me\r","'methinks,' said he, 'it would be no great shame\r","if we should strike a stroke to set us free;\r","let 's knock that old black fellow on the head,\r","and march away- 't were easier done than said'\r","'yes,' said the other, 'and when done, what then?\r","how get out? how the devil got we in?\r","and when we once were fairly out, and when\r","from saint bartholomew we have saved our skin,\r","to-morrow 'd see us in some other den,\r","and worse off than we hitherto have been;\r","besides, i 'm hungry, and just now would take,\r","like esau, for my birthright a beef-steak\r","'we must be near some place of man's abode;-\r","for the old negro's confidence in creeping,\r","with his two captives, by so queer a road,\r","shows that he thinks his friends have not been sleeping;\r","a single cry would bring them all abroad:\r","'t is therefore better looking before leaping-\r","and there, you see, this turn has brought us through,\r","by jove, a noble palacelighted too'\r","it was indeed a wide extensive building\r","which open'd on their view, and o'er the front\r","there seem'd to be besprent a deal of gilding\r","and various hues, as is the turkish wont,-\r","a gaudy taste; for they are little skill'd in\r","the arts of which these lands were once the font:\r","each villa on the bosphorus looks a screen\r","new painted, or a pretty opera-scene\r","and nearer as they came, a genial savour\r","of certain stews, and roast-meats, and pilaus,\r","things which in hungry mortals' eyes find favour,\r","made juan in his harsh intentions pause,\r","    \r","and put himself upon his good behaviour:\r","his friend, too, adding a new saving clause,\r","said, 'in heaven's name let's get some supper now,\r","and then i 'm with you, if you 're for a row'\r","some talk of an appeal unto some passion,\r","some to men's feelings, others to their reason;\r","the last of these was never much the fashion,\r","for reason thinks all reasoning out of season\r","some speakers whine, and others lay the lash on,\r","but more or less continue still to tease on,\r","with arguments according to their 'forte;'\r","but no one dreams of ever being short-\r","but i digress: of all appeals,- although\r","i grant the power of pathos, and of gold,\r","of beauty, flattery, threats, a shilling,- no\r","method 's more sure at moments to take hold\r","of the best feelings of mankind, which grow\r","more tender, as we every day behold,\r","than that all-softening, overpowering knell,\r","the tocsin of the soul- the dinner-bell\r","turkey contains no bells, and yet men dine;\r","and juan and his friend, albeit they heard\r","no christian knoll to table, saw no line\r","of lackeys usher to the feast prepared,\r","yet smelt roast-meat, beheld a huge fire shine,\r","and cooks in motion with their clean arms bared,\r","and gazed around them to the left and right\r","with the prophetic eye of appetite\r","and giving up all notions of resistance,\r","they follow'd close behind their sable guide,\r","who little thought that his own crack'd existence\r","was on the point of being set aside:\r","he motion'd them to stop at some small distance,\r","and knocking at the gate, 't was open'd wide,\r","and a magnificent large hall display'd\r","the asian pomp of ottoman parade\r","i won't describe; description is my forte,\r","     \r","but every fool describes in these bright days\r","his wondrous journey to some foreign court,\r","and spawns his quarto, and demands your praise-\r","death to his publisher, to him 't is sport;\r","while nature, tortured twenty thousand ways,\r","resigns herself with exemplary patience\r","to guide-books, rhymes, tours, sketches, illustrations\r","along this hall, and up and down, some, squatted\r","upon their hams, were occupied at chess;\r","others in monosyllable talk chatted,\r","and some seem'd much in love with their own dress\r","and divers smoked superb pipes decorated\r","with amber mouths of greater price or less;\r","and several strutted, others slept, and some\r","prepared for supper with a glass of rum\r","as the black eunuch enter'd with his brace\r","of purchased infidels, some raised their eyes\r","a moment without slackening from their pace;\r","but those who sate ne'er stirr'd in anywise:\r","one or two stared the captives in the face,\r","just as one views a horse to guess his price;\r","some nodded to the negro from their station,\r","but no one troubled him with conversation\r","he leads them through the hall, and, without stopping,\r","on through a farther range of goodly rooms,\r","splendid but silent, save in one, where, dropping,\r","a marble fountain echoes through the glooms\r","of night which robe the chamber, or where popping\r","some female head most curiously presumes\r","to thrust its black eyes through the door or lattice,\r","as wondering what the devil a noise that is\r","some faint lamps gleaming from the lofty walls\r","gave light enough to hint their farther way,\r","but not enough to show the imperial halls,\r","in all the flashing of their full array;\r","perhaps there 's nothing- i 'll not say appals,\r","but saddens more by night as well as day,\r","than an enormous room without a soul\r","   \r","to break the lifeless splendour of the whole\r","two or three seem so little, one seems nothing:\r","in deserts, forests, crowds, or by the shore,\r","there solitude, we know, has her full growth in\r","the spots which were her realms for evermore;\r","but in a mighty hall or gallery, both in\r","more modern buildings and those built of yore,\r","a kind of death comes o'er us all alone,\r","seeing what 's meant for many with but one\r","a neat, snug study on a winter's night,\r","a book, friend, single lady, or a glass\r","of claret, sandwich, and an appetite,\r","are things which make an english evening pass;\r","though certes by no means so grand a sight\r","as is a theatre lit up by gas\r","i pass my evenings in long galleries solely,\r","and that 's the reason i 'm so melancholy\r","alas! man makes that great which makes him little:\r","i grant you in a church 't is very well:\r","what speaks of heaven should by no means be brittle,\r","but strong and lasting, till no tongue can tell\r","their names who rear'd it; but huge houses fit ill-\r","and huge tombs worse- mankind, since adam fell:\r","methinks the story of the tower of babel\r","might teach them this much better than i 'm able\r","babel was nimrod's hunting-box, and then\r","a town of gardens, walls, and wealth amazing,\r","where nabuchadonosor, king of men,\r","reign'd, till one summer's day he took to grazing,\r","and daniel tamed the lions in their den,\r","the people's awe and admiration raising;\r","'t was famous, too, for thisbe and for pyramus,\r","and the calumniated queen semiramis\r","that injured queen by chroniclers so coarse\r","has been accused i doubt not by conspiracy\r","of an improper friendship for her horse\r","love, like religion, sometimes runs to heresy:\r","this monstrous tale had probably its source\r","for such exaggerations here and there i see\r","in writing 'courser' by mistake for 'courier:'\r","i wish the case could come before a jury here\r","but to resume,- should there be what may not\r","be in these days? some infidels, who don't,\r","because they can't find out the very spot\r","of that same babel, or because they won't\r","though claudius rich, esquire, some bricks has got,\r","and written lately two memoirs upon't,\r","believe the jews, those unbelievers, who\r","must be believed, though they believe not you,\r","yet let them think that horace has exprest\r","shortly and sweetly the masonic folly\r","of those, forgetting the great place of rest,\r","who give themsees to architecture wholly;\r","we know where things and men must end at best:\r","a moral like all morals melancholy,\r","and 'et sepulchri immemor struis domos'\r","shows that we build when we should but entomb us\r","at last they reach'd a quarter most retired,\r","where echo woke as if from a long slumber;\r","though full of all things which could be desired,\r","one wonder'd what to do with such a number\r","of articles which nobody required;\r","here wealth had done its utmost to encumber\r","with furniture an exquisite apartment,\r","which puzzled nature much to know what art meant\r","it seem'd, however, but to open on\r","a range or suite of further chambers, which\r","might lead to heaven knows where; but in this one\r","the movables were prodigally rich:\r","sofas 't was half a sin to sit upon,\r","so costly were they; carpets every stitch\r","of workmanship so rare, they made you wish\r","you could glide o'er them like a golden fish\r","the black, however, without hardly deigning\r","a glance at that which wrapt the slaves in wonder,\r","trampled what they scarce trod for fear of staining,\r","as if the milky way their feet was under\r","with all its stars; and with a stretch attaining\r","a certain press or cupboard niched in yonder-\r","in that remote recess which you may see-\r","or if you don't the fault is not in me,-\r","i wish to be perspicuous; and the black,\r","i say, unlocking the recess, pull'd forth\r","a quantity of clothes fit for the back\r","of any mussulman, whate'er his worth;\r","and of variety there was no lack-\r","and yet, though i have said there was no dearth,\r","he chose himself to point out what he thought\r","most proper for the christians he had bought\r","the suit he thought most suitable to each\r","was, for the elder and the stouter, first\r","a candiote cloak, which to the knee might reach,\r","and trousers not so tight that they would burst,\r","but such as fit an asiatic breech;\r","a shawl, whose folds in cashmire had been nurst,\r","slippers of saffron, dagger rich and handy;\r","in short, all things which form a turkish dandy\r","while he was dressing, baba, their black friend,\r","hinted the vast advantages which they\r","might probably attain both in the end,\r","if they would but pursue the proper way\r","which fortune plainly seem'd to recommend;\r","and then he added, that he needs must say,\r","''t would greatly tend to better their condition,\r","if they would condescend to circumcision\r","'for his own part, he really should rejoice\r","to see them true believers, but no less\r","would leave his proposition to their choice'\r","the other, thanking him for this excess\r","of goodness, in thus leaving them a voice\r","in such a trifle, scarcely could express\r","'sufficiently' he said 'his approbation\r","of all the customs of this polish'd nation\r","'for his own share- he saw but small objection\r","to so respectable an ancient rite;\r","and, after swallowing down a slight refection,\r","for which he own'd a present appetite,\r","he doubted not a few hours of reflection\r","would reconcile him to the business quite'\r","'will it?' said juan, sharply: 'strike me dead,\r","but they as soon shall circumcise my head!\r","'cut off a thousand heads, before-'- 'now, pray,'\r","replied the other, 'do not interrupt:\r","you put me out in what i had to say\r","siras i said, as soon as i have supt,\r","i shall perpend if your proposal may\r","be such as i can properly accept;\r","provided always your great goodness still\r","remits the matter to our own free-will'\r","baba eyed juan, and said, 'be so good\r","as dress yourself-' and pointed out a suit\r","in which a princess with great pleasure would\r","array her limbs; but juan standing mute,\r","as not being in a masquerading mood,\r","gave it a slight kick with his christian foot;\r","and when the old negro told him to 'get ready,'\r","replied, 'old gentleman, i 'm not a lady'\r","'what you may be, i neither know nor care,'\r","said baba; 'but pray do as i desire:\r","i have no more time nor many words to spare'\r","'at least,' said juan, 'sure i may enquire\r","the cause of this odd travesty?'- 'forbear,'\r","said baba, 'to be curious; 't will transpire,\r","no doubt, in proper place, and time, and season:\r","i have no authority to tell the reason'\r","'then if i do,' said juan, 'i 'll be-'- 'hold!'\r","rejoin'd the negro, 'pray be not provoking;\r","this spirit 's well, but it may wax too bold,\r","and you will find us not top fond of joking'\r","    \r","'what, sir!' said juan, 'shall it e'er be told\r","that i unsex'd my dress?' but baba, stroking\r","the things down, said, 'incense me, and i call\r","those who will leave you of no sex at all\r","'i offer you a handsome suit of clothes:\r","a woman's, true; but then there is a cause\r","why you should wear them'- 'what, though my soul loathes\r","the effeminate garb?'- thus, after a short pause,\r","sigh'd juan, muttering also some slight oaths,\r","'what the devil shall i do with all this gauze?'\r","thus he profanely term'd the finest lace\r","which e'er set off a marriage-morning face\r","and then he swore; and, sighing, on he slipp'd\r","a pair of trousers of flesh-colour'd silk;\r","next with a virgin zone he was equipp'd,\r","which girt a slight chemise as white as milk;\r","but tugging on his petticoat, he tripp'd,\r","which- as we say- or, as the scotch say, whilk\r","the rhyme obliges me to this; sometimes\r","monarchs are less imperative than rhymes-\r","whilk, which or what you please, was owing to\r","his garment's novelty, and his being awkward:\r","and yet at last he managed to get through\r","his toilet, though no doubt a little backward:\r","the negro baba help'd a little too,\r","when some untoward part of raiment stuck hard;\r","and, wrestling both his arms into a gown,\r","he paused, and took a survey up and down\r","one difficulty still remain'd- his hair\r","was hardly long enough; but baba found\r","so many false long tresses all to spare,\r","that soon his head was most completely crown'd,\r","after the manner then in fashion there;\r","and this addition with such gems was bound\r","as suited the ensemble of his toilet,\r","while baba made him comb his head and oil it\r","and now being femininely all array'd,\r","     \r","with some small aid from scissors, paint, and tweezers,\r","he look'd in almost all respects a maid,\r","and baba smilingly exclaim'd, 'you see, sirs,\r","a perfect transformation here display'd;\r","and now, then, you must come along with me, sirs,\r","that is- the lady:' clapping his hands twice,\r","four blacks were at his elbow in a trice\r","'you, sir,' said baba, nodding to the one,\r","'will please to accompany those gentlemen\r","to supper; but you, worthy christian nun,\r","will follow me: no trifling, sir; for when\r","i say a thing, it must at once be done\r","what fear you? think you this a lion's den?\r","why, 't is a palace; where the truly wise\r","anticipate the prophet's paradise\r","'you fool! i tell you no one means you harm'\r","'so much the better,' juan said, 'for them;\r","else they shall feel the weight of this my arm,\r","which is not quite so light as you may deem\r","i yield thus far; but soon will break the charm\r","if any take me for that which i seem:\r","so that i trust for everybody's sake,\r","that this disguise may lead to no mistake'\r","'blockhead! come on, and see,' quoth baba; while\r","don juan, turning to his comrade, who\r","though somewhat grieved, could scarce forbear a smile\r","upon the metamorphosis in view,-\r","'farewell!' they mutually exclaim'd: 'this soil\r","seems fertile in adventures strange and new;\r","one 's turn'd half mussulman, and one a maid,\r","by this old black enchanter's unsought aid'\r","'farewell!' said juan: 'should we meet no more,\r","i wish you a good appetite'- 'farewell!'\r","replied the other; 'though it grieves me sore;\r","when we next meet we 'll have a tale to tell:\r","we needs must follow when fate puts from shore\r","keep your good name; though eve herself once fell'\r","'nay,' quoth the maid, 'the sultan's self shan't carry me,\r","      \r","unless his highness promises to marry me\r","and thus they parted, each by separate doors;\r","baba led juan onward room by room\r","through glittering galleries and o'er marble floors,\r","till a gigantic portal through the gloom,\r","haughty and huge, along the distance lowers;\r","and wafted far arose a rich perfume:\r","it seem'd as though they came upon a shrine,\r","for all was vast, still, fragrant, and divine\r","the giant door was broad, and bright, and high,\r","of gilded bronze, and carved in curious guise;\r","warriors thereon were battling furiously;\r","here stalks the victor, there the vanquish'd lies;\r","there captives led in triumph droop the eye,\r","and in perspective many a squadron flies:\r","it seems the work of times before the line\r","of rome transplanted fell with constantine\r","this massy portal stood at the wide close\r","of a huge hall, and on its either side\r","two little dwarfs, the least you could suppose,\r","were sate, like ugly imps, as if allied\r","in mockery to the enormous gate which rose\r","o'er them in almost pyramidic pride:\r","the gate so splendid was in all its features,\r","you never thought about those little creatures,\r","until you nearly trod on them, and then\r","you started back in horror to survey\r","the wondrous hideousness of those small men,\r","whose colour was not black, nor white, nor grey,\r","but an extraneous mixture, which no pen\r","can trace, although perhaps the pencil may;\r","they were mis-shapen pigmies, deaf and dumb-\r","monsters, who cost a no less monstrous sum\r","their duty was- for they were strong, and though\r","they look'd so little, did strong things at times-\r","to ope this door, which they could really do,\r","the hinges being as smooth as rogers' rhymes;\r","and now and then, with tough strings of the bow,\r","as is the custom of those eastern climes,\r","to give some rebel pacha a cravat;\r","for mutes are generally used for that\r","they spoke by signs- that is, not spoke at all;\r","and looking like two incubi, they glared\r","as baba with his fingers made them fall\r","to heaving back the portal folds: it scared\r","juan a moment, as this pair so small\r","with shrinking serpent optics on him stared;\r","it was as if their little looks could poison\r","or fascinate whome'er they fix'd their eyes on\r","before they enter'd, baba paused to hint\r","to juan some slight lessons as his guide:\r","'if you could just contrive,' he said, 'to stint\r","that somewhat manly majesty of stride,\r","'t would be as well, and though there 's not much in 't\r","to swing a little less from side to side,\r","which has at times an aspect of the oddest;-\r","and also could you look a little modest,\r","''t would be convenient; for these mutes have eyes\r","like needles, which may pierce those petticoats;\r","and if they should discover your disguise,\r","you know how near us the deep bosphorus floats;\r","and you and i may chance, ere morning rise,\r","to find our way to marmora without boats,\r","stitch'd up in sacks- a mode of navigation\r","a good deal practised here upon occasion'\r","with this encouragement, he led the way\r","into a room still nobler than the last;\r","a rich confusion form'd a disarray\r","in such sort, that the eye along it cast\r","could hardly carry anything away,\r","object on object flash'd so bright and fast;\r","a dazzling mass of gems, and gold, and glitter,\r","magnificently mingled in a litter\r","wealth had done wonders- taste not much; such things\r","     \r","occur in orient palaces, and even\r","in the more chasten'd domes of western kings\r","of which i have also seen some six or seven,\r","where i can't say or gold or diamond flings\r","great lustre, there is much to be forgiven;\r","groups of bad statues, tables, chairs, and pictures,\r","on which i cannot pause to make my strictures\r","in this imperial hall, at distance lay\r","under a canopy, and there reclined\r","quite in a confidential queenly way,\r","a lady; baba stopp'd, and kneeling sign'd\r","to juan, who though not much used to pray,\r","knelt down by instinct, wondering in his mind,\r","what all this meant: while baba bow'd and bended\r","his head, until the ceremony ended\r","the lady rising up with such an air\r","as venus rose with from the wave, on them\r","bent like an antelope a paphian pair\r","of eyes, which put out each surrounding gem;\r","and raising up an arm as moonlight fair,\r","she sign'd to baba, who first kiss'd the hem\r","of her deep purple robe, and speaking low,\r","pointed to juan who remain'd below\r","her presence was as lofty as her state;\r","her beauty of that overpowering kind,\r","whose force description only would abate:\r","i 'd rather leave it much to your own mind,\r","than lessen it by what i could relate\r","of forms and features; it would strike you blind\r","could i do justice to the full detail;\r","so, luckily for both, my phrases fail\r","thus much however i may add,- her years\r","were ripe, they might make six-and-twenty springs;\r","but there are forms which time to touch forbears,\r","and turns aside his scythe to vulgar things,\r","such as was mary's queen of scots; true- tears\r","and love destroy; and sapping sorrow wrings\r","charms from the charmer, yet some never grow\r","ugly; for instance- ninon de l'enclos\r","she spake some words to her attendants, who\r","composed a choir of girls, ten or a dozen,\r","and were all clad alike; like juan, too,\r","who wore their uniform, by baba chosen;\r","they form'd a very nymph-like looking crew,\r","which might have call'd diana's chorus 'cousin,'\r","as far as outward show may correspond;\r","i won't be bail for anything beyond\r","they bow'd obeisance and withdrew, retiring,\r","but not by the same door through which came in\r","baba and juan, which last stood admiring,\r","at some small distance, all he saw within\r","this strange saloon, much fitted for inspiring\r","marvel and praise; for both or none things win;\r","and i must say, i ne'er could see the very\r","great happiness of the 'nil admirari'\r","'not to admire is all the art i know\r","plain truth, dear murray, needs few flowers of speech\r","to make men happy, or to keep them so'\r","so take it in the very words of creech-\r","thus horace wrote we all know long ago;\r","and thus pope quotes the precept to re-teach\r","from his translation; but had none admired,\r","would pope have sung, or horace been inspired?\r","baba, when all the damsels were withdrawn,\r","motion'd to juan to approach, and then\r","a second time desired him to kneel down,\r","and kiss the lady's foot; which maxim when\r","he heard repeated, juan with a frown\r","drew himself up to his full height again,\r","and said, 'it grieved him, but he could not stoop\r","to any shoe, unless it shod the pope'\r","baba, indignant at this ill-timed pride,\r","made fierce remonstrances, and then a threat\r","he mutter'd but the last was given aside\r","about a bow-string- quite in vain; not yet\r","   \r","would juan bend, though 't were to mahomet's bride:\r","there 's nothing in the world like etiquette\r","in kingly chambers or imperial halls,\r","as also at the race and county balls\r","he stood like atlas, with a world of words\r","about his ears, and nathless would not bend:\r","the blood of all his line 's castilian lords\r","boil'd in his veins, and rather than descend\r","to stain his pedigree a thousand swords\r","a thousand times of him had made an end;\r","at length perceiving the 'foot' could not stand,\r","baba proposed that he should kiss the hand\r","here was an honourable compromise,\r","a half-way house of diplomatic rest,\r","where they might meet in much more peaceful guise;\r","and juan now his willingness exprest\r","to use all fit and proper courtesies,\r","adding, that this was commonest and best,\r","for through the south the custom still commands\r","the gentleman to kiss the lady's hands\r","and he advanced, though with but a bad grace,\r","though on more thorough-bred or fairer fingers\r","no lips e'er left their transitory trace;\r","on such as these the lip too fondly lingers,\r","and for one kiss would fain imprint a brace,\r","as you will see, if she you love shall bring hers\r","in contact; and sometimes even a fair stranger's\r","an almost tweemonth's constancy endangers\r","the lady eyed him o'er and o'er, and bade\r","baba retire, which he obey'd in style,\r","as if well used to the retreating trade;\r","and taking hints in good part all the while,\r","he whisper'd juan not to be afraid,\r","and looking on him with a sort of smile,\r","took leave, with such a face of satisfaction\r","as good men wear who have done a virtuous action\r","when he was gone, there was a sudden change:\r","i know not what might be the lady's thought,\r","but o'er her bright brow flash'd a tumult strange,\r","and into her dear cheek the blood was brought,\r","blood-red as sunset summer clouds which range\r","the verge of heaven; and in her large eyes wrought,\r","a mixture of sensations might be scann'd,\r","of half voluptuousness and half command\r","her form had all the softness of her sex,\r","her features all the sweetness of the devil,\r","when he put on the cherub to perple\r","eve, and paved god knows how the road to evil;\r","the sun himself was scarce more free from specks\r","than she from aught at which the eye could cavil;\r","yet, somehow, there was something somewhere wanting,\r","as if she rather order'd than was granting\r","something imperial, or imperious, threw\r","a chain o'er all she did; that is, a chain\r","was thrown as 't were about the neck of you,-\r","and rapture's self will seem almost a pain\r","with aught which looks like despotism in view:\r","our souls at least are free, and 't is in vain\r","we would against them make the flesh obey-\r","the spirit in the end will have its way\r","her very smile was haughty, though so sweet;\r","her very nod was not an inclination;\r","there was a self-will even in her small feet,\r","as though they were quite conscious of her station-\r","they trod as upon necks; and to complete\r","her state it is the custom of her nation,\r","a poniard deck'd her girdle, as the sign\r","she was a sultan's bride thank heaven, not mine!\r","'to hear and to obey' had been from birth\r","the law of all around her; to fulfill\r","all phantasies which yielded joy or mirth,\r","had been her slaves' chief pleasure, as her will;\r","her blood was high, her beauty scarce of earth:\r","judge, then, if her caprices e'er stood still;\r","had she but been a christian, i 've a notion\r","we should have found out the 'perpetual motion'\r","whate'er she saw and coveted was brought;\r","whate'er she did not see, if she supposed\r","it might be seen, with diligence was sought,\r","and when 't was found straightway the bargain closed;\r","there was no end unto the things she bought,\r","nor to the trouble which her fancies caused;\r","yet even her tyranny had such a grace,\r","the women pardon'd all except her face\r","juan, the latest of her whims, had caught\r","her eye in passing on his way to sale;\r","she order'd him directly to be bought,\r","and baba, who had ne'er been known to fail\r","in any kind of mischief to be wrought,\r","at all such auctions knew how to prevail:\r","she had no prudence, but he had; and this\r","explains the garb which juan took amiss\r","his youth and features favour'd the disguise,\r","and, should you ask how she, a sultan's bride,\r","could risk or compass such strange phantasies,\r","this i must leave sultanas to decide:\r","emperors are only husbands in wives' eyes,\r","and kings and consorts oft are mystified,\r","as we may ascertain with due precision,\r","some by experience, others by tradition\r","but to the main point, where we have been tending:-\r","she now conceived all difficulties past,\r","and deem'd herself extremely condescending\r","when, being made her property at last,\r","without more preface, in her blue eyes blending\r","passion and power, a glance on him she cast,\r","and merely saying, 'christian, canst thou love?'\r","conceived that phrase was quite enough to move\r","and so it was, in proper time and place;\r","but juan, who had still his mind o'erflowing\r","with haidee's isle and soft ionian face,\r","felt the warm blood, which in his face was glowing,\r"," \r","rush back upon his heart, which fill'd apace,\r","and left his cheeks as pale as snowdrops blowing;\r","these words went through his soul like arab-spears,\r","so that he spoke not, but burst into tears\r","she was a good deal shock'd; not shock'd at tears,\r","for women shed and use them at their liking;\r","but there is something when man's eye appears\r","wet, still more disagreeable and striking;\r","a woman's tear-drop melts, a man's half sears,\r","like molten lead, as if you thrust a pike in\r","his heart to force it out, for to be shorter\r","to them 't is a relief, to us a torture\r","and she would have consoled, but knew not how:\r","having no equals, nothing which had e'er\r","infected her with sympathy till now,\r","and never having dreamt what 't was to bear\r","aught of a serious, sorrowing kind, although\r","there might arise some pouting petty care\r","to cross her brow, she wonder'd how so near\r","her eyes another's eye could shed a tear\r","but nature teaches more than power can spoil,\r","and, when a strong although a strange sensation\r","moves- female hearts are such a genial soil\r","for kinder feelings, whatsoe'er their nation,\r","they naturally pour the 'wine and oil,'\r","samaritans in every situation;\r","and thus gulbeyaz, though she knew not why,\r","felt an odd glistening moisture in her eye\r","but tears must stop like all things else; and soon\r","juan, who for an instant had been moved\r","to such a sorrow by the intrusive tone\r","of one who dared to ask if 'he had loved,'\r","call'd back the stoic to his eyes, which shone\r","bright with the very weakness he reproved;\r","and although sensitive to beauty, he\r","felt most indignant still at not being free\r","gulbeyaz, for the first time in her days,\r","was much embarrass'd, never having met\r","in all her life with aught save prayers and praise;\r","and as she also risk'd her life to get\r","him whom she meant to tutor in love's ways\r","into a comfortable tete-a-tete,\r","to lose the hour would make her quite a martyr,\r","and they had wasted now almost a quarter\r","i also would suggest the fitting time\r","to gentlemen in any such like case,\r","that is to say in a meridian clime-\r","with us there is more law given to the chase,\r","but here a small delay forms a great crime:\r","so recollect that the extremest grace\r","is just two minutes for your declaration-\r","a moment more would hurt your reputation\r","juan's was good; and might have been still better,\r","but he had got haidee into his head:\r","however strange, he could not yet forget her,\r","which made him seem exceedingly ill-bred\r","gulbeyaz, who look'd on him as her debtor\r","for having had him to her palace led,\r","began to blush up to the eyes, and then\r","grow deadly pale, and then blush back again\r","at length, in an imperial way, she laid\r","her hand on his, and bending on him eyes\r","which needed not an empire to persuade,\r","look'd into his for love, where none replies:\r","her brow grew black, but she would not upbraid,\r","that being the last thing a proud woman tries;\r","she rose, and pausing one chaste moment, threw\r","herself upon his breast, and there she grew\r","this was an awkward test, as juan found,\r","but he was steel'd by sorrow, wrath, and pride:\r","with gentle force her white arms he unwound,\r","and seated her all drooping by his side,\r","then rising haughtily he glanced around,\r","and looking coldly in her face, he cried,\r","'the prison'd eagle will not pair, nor\r","serve a sultana's sensual phantasy\r","'thou ask'st if i can love? be this the proof\r","how much i have loved- that i love not thee!\r","in this vile garb, the distaff, web, and woof,\r","were fitter for me: love is for the free!\r","i am not dazzled by this splendid roof,\r","whate'er thy power, and great it seems to be;\r","heads bow, knees bend, eyes watch around a throne,\r","and hands obey- our hearts are still our own'\r","this was a truth to us extremely trite;\r","not so to her, who ne'er had heard such things:\r","she deem'd her least command must yield delight,\r","earth being only made for queens and kings\r","if hearts lay on the left side or the right\r","she hardly knew, to such perfection brings\r","legitimacy its born votaries, when\r","aware of their due royal rights o'er men\r","besides, as has been said, she was so fair\r","as even in a much humbler lot had made\r","a kingdom or confusion anywhere,\r","and also, as may be presumed, she laid\r","some stress on charms, which seldom are, if e'er,\r","by their possessors thrown into the shade:\r","she thought hers gave a double 'right divine;'\r","and half of that opinion 's also mine\r","remember, or if you can not imagine,\r","ye, who have kept your chastity when young,\r","while some more desperate dowager has been waging\r","love with you, and been in the dog-days stung\r","by your refusal, recollect her raging!\r","or recollect all that was said or sung\r","on such a subject; then suppose the face\r","of a young downright beauty in this case\r","suppose,- but you already have supposed,\r","the spouse of potiphar, the lady booby,\r","phaedra, and all which story has disclosed\r","of good examples; pity that so few by\r","     \r","poets and private tutors are exposed,\r","to educate- ye youth of europe- you by!\r","but when you have supposed the few we know,\r","you can't suppose gulbeyaz' angry brow\r","a tigress robb'd of young, a lioness,\r","or any interesting beast of prey,\r","are similes at hand for the distress\r","of ladies who can not have their own way;\r","but though my turn will not be served with less,\r","these don't express one half what i should say:\r","for what is stealing young ones, few or many,\r","to cutting short their hopes of having any?\r","the love of offspring 's nature's general law,\r","from tigresses and cubs to ducks and ducklings;\r","there 's nothing whets the beak, or arms the claw\r","like an invasion of their babes and sucklings;\r","and all who have seen a human nursery, saw\r","how mothers love their children's squalls and chucklings;\r","this strong extreme effect to tire no longer\r","your patience shows the cause must still be stronger\r","if i said fire flash'd from gulbeyaz' eyes,\r","'t were nothing- for her eyes flash'd always fire;\r","or said her cheeks assumed the deepest dyes,\r","i should but bring disgrace upon the dyer,\r","so supernatural was her passion's rise;\r","for ne'er till now she knew a check'd desire:\r","even ye who know what a check'd woman is\r","enough, god knows! would much fall short of this\r","her rage was but a minute's, and 't was well-\r","a moment's more had slain her; but the while\r","it lasted 't was like a short glimpse of hell:\r","nought 's more sublime than energetic bile,\r","though horrible to see yet grand to tell,\r","like ocean warring 'gainst a rocky isle;\r","and the deep passions flashing through her form\r","made her a beautiful embodied storm\r","a vulgar tempest 't were to a typhoon\r","     \r","to match a common fury with her rage,\r","and yet she did not want to reach the moon,\r","like moderate hotspur on the immortal page;\r","her anger pitch'd into a lower tune,\r","perhaps the fault of her soft sex and age-\r","her wish was but to 'kill, kill, kill,' like lear's,\r","and then her thirst of blood was quench'd in tears\r","a storm it raged, and like the storm it pass'd,\r","pass'd without words- in fact she could not speak;\r","and then her sex's shame broke in at last,\r","a sentiment till then in her but weak,\r","but now it flow'd in natural and fast,\r","as water through an unexpected leak;\r","for she felt humbled- and humiliation\r","is sometimes good for people in her station\r","it teaches them that they are flesh and blood,\r","it also gently hints to them that others,\r","although of clay, are yet not quite of mud;\r","that urns and pipkins are but fragile brothers,\r","and works of the same pottery, bad or good,\r","though not all born of the same sires and mothers:\r","it teaches- heaven knows only what it teaches,\r","but sometimes it may mend, and often reaches\r","her first thought was to cut off juan's head;\r","her second, to cut only his- acquaintance;\r","her third, to ask him where he had been bred;\r","her fourth, to rally him into repentance;\r","her fifth, to call her maids and go to bed;\r","her sixth, to stab herself; her seventh, to sentence\r","the lash to baba:- but her grand resource\r","was to sit down again, and cry of course\r","she thought to stab herself, but then she had\r","the dagger close at hand, which made it awkward;\r","for eastern stays are little made to pad,\r","so that a poniard pierces if 't is stuck hard:\r","she thought of killing juan- but, poor lad!\r","though he deserved it well for being so backward,\r","the cutting off his head was not the art\r","most likely to attain her aim- his heart\r","juan was moved; he had made up his mind\r","to be impaled, or quarter'd as a dish\r","for dogs, or to be slain with pangs refined,\r","or thrown to lions, or made baits for fish,\r","and thus heroically stood resign'd,\r","rather than sin- except to his own wish:\r","but all his great preparatives for dying\r","dissoed like snow before a woman crying\r","as through his palms bob acres' valour oozed,\r","so juan's virtue ebb'd, i know not how;\r","and first he wonder'd why he had refused;\r","and then, if matters could be made up now;\r","and next his savage virtue he accused,\r","just as a friar may accuse his vow,\r","or as a dame repents her of her oath,\r","which mostly ends in some small breach of both\r","so he began to stammer some excuses;\r","but words are not enough in such a matter,\r","although you borrow'd all that e'er the muses\r","have sung, or even a dandy's dandiest chatter,\r","or all the figures castlereagh abuses;\r","just as a languid smile began to flatter\r","his peace was making, but before he ventured\r","further, old baba rather briskly enter'd\r","'bride of the sun! and sister of the moon!'\r","'t was thus he spake 'and empress of the earth!\r","whose frown would put the spheres all out of tune,\r","whose smile makes all the planets dance with mirth,\r","your slave brings tidings- he hopes not too soon-\r","which your sublime attention may be worth:\r","the sun himself has sent me like a ray,\r","to hint that he is coming up this way'\r","'is it,' exclaim'd gulbeyaz, 'as you say?\r","i wish to heaven he would not shine till morning!\r","but bid my women form the milky way\r","hence, my old comet! give the stars due warning-\r","and, christian! mingle with them as you may,\r","and as you 'd have me pardon your past scorning-'\r","here they were interrupted by a humming\r","sound, and then by a cry, 'the sultan 's coming!'\r","first came her damsels, a decorous file,\r","and then his highness' eunuchs, black and white;\r","the train might reach a quarter of a mile:\r","his majesty was always so polite\r","as to announce his visits a long while\r","before he came, especially at night;\r","for being the last wife of the emperour,\r","she was of course the favorite of the four\r","his highness was a man of solemn port,\r","shawl'd to the nose, and bearded to the eyes,\r","snatch'd from a prison to preside at court,\r","his lately bowstrung brother caused his rise;\r","he was as good a sovereign of the sort\r","as any mention'd in the histories\r","of cantemir, or knolles, where few shine\r","save solyman, the glory of their line\r","he went to mosque in state, and said his prayers\r","with more than 'oriental scrupulosity;'\r","he left to his vizier all state affairs,\r","and show'd but little royal curiosity:\r","i know not if he had domestic cares-\r","no process proved connubial animosity;\r","four wives and twice five hundred maids, unseen,\r","were ruled as calmly as a christian queen\r","if now and then there happen'd a slight slip,\r","little was heard of criminal or crime;\r","the story scarcely pass'd a single lip-\r","the sack and sea had settled all in time,\r","from which the secret nobody could rip:\r","the public knew no more than does this rhyme;\r","no scandals made the daily press a curse-\r","morals were better, and the fish no worse\r","he saw with his own eyes the moon was round,\r","    \r","was also certain that the earth was square,\r","because he had journey'd fifty miles, and found\r","no sign that it was circular anywhere;\r","his empire also was without a bound:\r","'t is true, a little troubled here and there,\r","by rebel pachas, and encroaching giaours,\r","but then they never came to 'the seven towers;'\r","except in shape of envoys, who were sent\r","to lodge there when a war broke out, according\r","to the true law of nations, which ne'er meant\r","those scoundrels, who have never had a sword in\r","their dirty diplomatic hands, to vent\r","their spleen in making strife, and safely wording\r","their lies, yclep'd despatches, without risk or\r","the singeing of a single inky whisker\r","he had fifty daughters and four dozen sons,\r","of whom all such as came of age were stow'd,\r","the former in a palace, where like nuns\r","they lived till some bashaw was sent abroad,\r","when she, whose turn it was, was wed at once,\r","sometimes at six years old- though it seems odd,\r","'t is true; the reason is, that the bashaw\r","must make a present to his sire in law\r","his sons were kept in prison, till they grew\r","of years to fill a bowstring or the throne,\r","one or the other, but which of the two\r","could yet be known unto the fates alone;\r","meantime the education they went through\r","was princely, as the proofs have always shown:\r","so that the heir apparent still was found\r","no less deserving to be hang'd than crown'd\r","his majesty saluted his fourth spouse\r","with all the ceremonies of his rank,\r","who clear'd her sparkling eyes and smooth'd her brows,\r","as suits a matron who has play'd a prank;\r","these must seem doubly mindful of their vows,\r","to save the credit of their breaking bank:\r","to no men are such cordial greetings given\r","  \r","as those whose wives have made them fit for heaven\r","his highness cast around his great black eyes,\r","and looking, as he always look'd, perceived\r","juan amongst the damsels in disguise,\r","at which he seem'd no whit surprised nor grieved,\r","but just remark'd with air sedate and wise,\r","while still a fluttering sigh gulbeyaz heaved,\r","'i see you 've bought another girl; 't is pity\r","that a mere christian should be half so pretty'\r","this compliment, which drew all eyes upon\r","the new-bought virgin, made her blush and shake\r","her comrades, also, thought themsees undone:\r","oh! mahomet! that his majesty should take\r","such notice of a giaour, while scarce to one\r","of them his lips imperial ever spake!\r","there was a general whisper, toss, and wriggle,\r","but etiquette forbade them all to giggle\r","the turks do well to shut- at least, sometimes-\r","the women up, because, in sad reality,\r","their chastity in these unhappy climes\r","is not a thing of that astringent quality\r","which in the north prevents precocious crimes,\r","and makes our snow less pure than our morality;\r","the sun, which yearly melts the polar ice,\r","has quite the contrary effect on vice\r","thus in the east they are extremely strict,\r","and wedlock and a padlock mean the same;\r","excepting only when the former 's pick'd\r","it ne'er can be replaced in proper frame;\r","spoilt, as a pipe of claret is when prick'd:\r","but then their own polygamy 's to blame;\r","why don't they knead two virtuous souls for life\r","into that moral centaur, man and wife?\r","thus far our chronicle; and now we pause,\r","though not for want of matter; but 't is time\r","according to the ancient epic laws,\r","to slacken sail, and anchor with our rhyme\r","let

tumbling first, and having in exchange\r","some pleasant jesting at the awkward stranger:\r","but juan had been early taught to range\r","the wilds, as doth an arab turn'd avenger,\r","so that his horse, or charger, hunter, hack,\r","knew that he had a rider on his back\r","and now in this new field, with some applause,\r","he clear'd hedge, ditch, and double post, and rail,\r","and never craned, and made but few 'faux pas,'\r","and only fretted when the scent 'gan fail\r","he broke, 'tis true, some statutes of the laws\r","of huntingfor the sagest youth is frail;\r","rode o'er the hounds, it may be, now and then,\r","and once o'er several country gentlemen\r","but on the whole, to general admiration\r","he acquitted both himself and horse: the squires\r","marvell'd at merit of another nation;\r","the boors cried 'dang it? who'd have thought it?'--sires,\r","the nestors of the sporting generation,\r","swore praises, and recall'd their former fires;\r","the huntsman's self relented to a grin,\r","and rated him almost a whipper-in\r","such were his trophies--not of spear and shield,\r","but leaps, and bursts, and sometimes foxes' brushes;\r","yet i must own,--although in this i yield\r","to patriot sympathy a briton's blushes,--\r","he thought at heart like courtly chesterfield,\r","who, after a long chase o'er hills, dales, bushes,\r","and what not, though he rode beyond all price,\r","ask'd next day, 'if men ever hunted twice?'\r","he also had a quality uncommon\r","to early risers after a long chase,\r","who wake in winter ere the cock can summon\r","december's drowsy day to his dull race,--\r","a quality agreeable to woman,\r","when her soft, liquid words run on apace,\r","who likes a listener, whether saint or sinner,--\r","he did not fall asleep just after dinner;\r","but, light and airy, stood on the alert,\r","and shone in the best part of dialogue,\r","by humouring always what they might assert,\r","and listening to the topics most in vogue;\r","now grave, now gay, but never dull or pert;\r","and smiling but in secret--cunning rogue!\r","he ne'er presumed to make an error clearer;-\r","in short, there never was a better hearer\r","     \r","and then he danced;- all foreigners excel\r","the serious angles in the eloquence\r","of pantomime;--he danced, i say, right well,\r","with emphasis, and also with good sense--\r","a thing in footing indispensable;\r","he danced without theatrical pretence,\r","not like a ballet-master in the van\r","of his drill'd nymphs, but like a gentleman\r","chaste were his steps, each kept within due bound,\r","and elegance was sprinkled o'er his figure;\r","like swift camilla, he scarce skimm'd the ground,\r","and rather held in than put forth his vigour;\r","and then he had an ear for music's sound,\r","which might defy a crotchet critic's rigour\r","such classic pas--sans flaws--set off our hero,\r","he glanced like a personified bolero;\r","or, like a flying hour before aurora,\r","in guido's famous fresco which alone\r","is worth a tour to rome, although no more a\r","remnant were there of the old world's sole throne\r","the 'tout ensemble' of his movements wore a\r","grace of the soft ideal, seldom shown,\r","and ne'er to be described; for to the dolour\r","of bards and prosers, words are void of colour\r","no marvel then he was a favourite;\r","a full -grown cupid, very much admired;\r","a little spoilt, but by no means so quite;\r","at least he kept his vanity retired\r","such was his tact, he could alike delight\r","the chaste, and those who are not so much inspired\r","the duchess of fitz-fulke, who loved 'tracasserie,'\r","began to treat him with some small 'agacerie'\r","she was a fine and somewhat full-blown blonde,\r","desirable, distinguish'd, celebrated\r","for several winters in the grand, grand monde\r","i'd rather not say what might be related\r","of her exploits, for this were ticklish ground;\r","besides there might be falsehood in what's stated:\r","her late performance had been a dead set\r","at lord augustus fitz-plantagenet\r","this noble personage began to look\r","a little black upon this new flirtation;\r","but such small licences must lovers brook,\r","mere freedoms of the female corporation\r","woe to the man who ventures a rebuke!\r","'twill but precipitate a situation\r","extremely disagreeable, but common\r","to calculators when they count on woman\r","the circle smiled, then whisper'd, and then sneer'd;\r","the misses bridled, and the matrons frown'd;\r","some hoped things might not turn out as they fear'd;\r","some would not deem such women could be found;\r","some ne'er believed one half of what they heard;\r","some look'd perplex'd, and others look'd profound;\r","and several pitied with sincere regret\r","poor lord augustus fitz-plantagenet\r","but what is odd, none ever named the duke,\r","who, one might think, was something in the affair;\r","true, he was absent, and, 'twas rumour'd, took\r","but small concern about the when, or where,\r","or what his consort did: if he could brook\r","her gaieties, none had a right to stare:\r","theirs was that best of unions, past all doubt,\r","which never meets, and therefore can't fall out\r","but, oh! that i should ever pen so sad a line!\r","fired with an abstract love of virtue, she,\r","my dian of the ephesians, lady adeline,\r","began to think the duchess' conduct free;\r","regretting much that she had chosen so bad a line,\r","and waxing chiller in her courtesy,\r","look'd grave and pale to see her friend's fragility,\r","for which most friends reserve their sensibility\r","there's nought in this bad world like sympathy:\r","'tis so becoming to the soul and face,\r","sets to soft music the harmonious sigh,\r","and robes sweet friendship in a brussels lace\r","without a friend, what were humanity,\r","to hunt our errors up with a good grace?\r","consoling us with'would you had thought twice!\r","ah, if you had but follow'd my advice!'\r","o job! you had two friends: one's quite enough,\r","especially when we are ill at ease;\r","they are but bad pilots when the weather's rough,\r","doctors less famous for their cures than fees\r","let no man grumble when his friends fall off,\r","as they will do like leaves at the first breeze:\r","when your affairs come round, one way or t'other,\r","go to the coffee-house, and take another\r","but this is not my maxim: had it been,\r","some heart-aches had been spared me: yet i care not--\r","i would not be a tortoise in his screen\r","of stubborn shell, which waves and weather wear not\r","'tis better on the whole to have felt and seen\r","that which humanity may bear, or bear not:\r","'twill teach discernment to the sensitive,\r","and not to pour their ocean in a sieve\r","of all the horrid, hideous notes of woe,\r","sadder than owl-songs or the midnight blast,\r","is that portentous phrase, 'i told you so,'\r","utter'd by friends, those prophets of the past,\r","who, 'stead of saying what you now should do,\r","own they foresaw that you would fall at last,\r","and solace your slight lapse 'gainst 'bonos mores,'\r","with a long memorandum of old stories\r","the lady adeline's serene severity\r","was not confined to feeling for her friend,\r","whose fame she rather doubted with posterity,\r","unless her habits should begin to mend:\r","but juan also shared in her austerity,\r","but mix'd with pity, pure as e'er was penn'd:\r","his inexperience moved her gentle ruth,\r","and as her junior by six weeks his youth\r"," \r","these forty days' advantage of her years--\r","and hers were those which can face calculation,\r","boldly referring to the list of peers\r","and noble births, nor dread the enumeration--\r","gave her a right to have maternal fears\r","for a young gentleman's fit education,\r","though she was far from that leap year, whose leap,\r","in female dates, strikes time all of a heap\r","this may be fix'd at somewhere before thirty--\r","say seven-and-twenty; for i never knew\r","the strictest in chronology and virtue\r","advance beyond, while they could pass for new\r","o time! why dost not pause? thy scythe, so dirty\r","with rust, should surely cease to hack and hew\r","reset it; shave more smoothly, also slower,\r","if but to keep thy credit as a mower\r","but adeline was far from that ripe age,\r","whose ripeness is but bitter at the best:\r","'twas rather her experience made her sage,\r","for she had seen the world and stood its test,\r","as i have said in--i forget what page;\r","my muse despises reference, as you have guess'd\r","by this time;--but strike six from seven -and -twenty,\r","and you will find her sum of years in plenty\r","at sixteen she came out; presented, vaunted,\r","she put all coronets into commotion:\r","at seventeen, too, the world was still enchanted\r","with the new venus of their brilliant ocean:\r","at eighteen, though below her feet still panted\r","a hecatomb of suitors with devotion,\r","she had consented to create again\r","that adam, call'd 'the happiest of men'\r","since then she had sparkled through three glowing winters,\r","admired, adored; but also so correct,\r","that she had puzzled all the acutest hinters,\r","without the apparel of being circumspect:\r","they could not even glean the slightest splinters\r","from off the marble, which had no defect\r","      \r","she had also snatch'd a moment since her marriage\r","to bear a son and heirand one miscarriage\r","fondly the wheeling fire-flies flew around her,\r","those little glitterers of the london night;\r","but none of these possess'd a sting to wound her -\r","she was a pitch beyond a coxcomb's flight\r","perhaps she wish'd an aspirant profounder;\r","but whatsoe'er she wish'd, she acted right;\r","and whether coldness, pride, or virtue dignify\r","a woman, so she's good, what does it signify?\r","i hate a motive, like a lingering bottle\r","which with the landlord makes too long a stand,\r","leaving all-claretless the unmoisten'd throttle,\r","especially with politics on hand;\r","i hate it, as i hate a drove of cattle,\r","who whirl the dust as simooms whirl the sand;\r","i hate it, as i hate an argument,\r","a laureate's ode, or servile peer's 'content'\r","'tis

eclat,\r","both to the duchess and diplomatist,\r","the lady adeline, as soon's she saw\r","that juan was unlikely to resist\r","for foreigners don't know that a faux pas\r","in england ranks quite on a different list\r","from those of other lands unblest with juries,\r","whose verdict for such sin a certain cure is;-\r","the lady adeline resoed to take\r","such measures as she thought might best impede\r","the farther progress of this sad mistake\r","     \r","she thought with some simplicity indeed;\r","but innocence is bold even at the stake,\r","and simple in the world, and doth not need\r","nor use those palisades by dames erected,\r","whose virtue lies in never being detected\r","it was not that she fear'd the very worst:\r","his grace was an enduring, married man,\r","and was not likely all at once to burst\r","into a scene, and swell the clients' clan\r","of doctors' commons: but she dreaded first\r","the magic of her grace's talisman,\r","and next a quarrel as he seem'd to fret\r","with lord augustus fitz-plantagenet\r","her grace, too, pass'd for being an intrigante,\r","and somewhat mechante in her amorous sphere;\r","one of those pretty, precious plagues, which haunt\r","a lover with caprices soft and dear,\r","that like to make a quarrel, when they can't\r","find one, each day of the delightful year;\r","bewitching, torturing, as they freeze or glow,\r","andwhat is worst of allwon't let you go:\r","the sort of thing to turn a young man's head,\r","or make a werter of him in the end\r","no wonder then a purer soul should dread\r","this sort of chaste liaison for a friend;\r","it were much better to be wed or dead,\r","than wear a heart a woman loves to rend\r","'t is best to pause, and think, ere you rush on,\r","if that a 'bonne

juan with a smile\r","lord henry heard her plans of artless art\r","to wean don juan from the siren's wile;\r","and answer'd, like a statesman or a prophet,\r","in such guise that she could make nothing of it\r","     \r","firstly, he said, 'he never interfered\r","in any body's business but the king's:'\r","next, that 'he never judged from what appear'd,\r","without strong reason, of those sort of things:'\r","thirdly, that 'juan had more brain than beard,\r","and was not to be held in leading strings;'\r","and fourthly, what need hardly be said twice,\r","'that good but rarely came from good advice'\r","and, therefore, doubtless to approve the truth\r","of the last axiom, he advised his spouse\r","to leave the parties to themsees, forsooth -\r","at least as far as bienseance allows:\r","that time would temper juan's faults of youth;\r","that young men rarely made monastic vows;\r","that opposition only more attaches -\r","but here a messenger brought in despatches:\r","and being of the council call'd 'the privy,'\r","lord henry walk'd into his cabinet,\r","to furnish matter for some future livy\r","to tell how he reduced the nation's debt;\r","and if their full contents i do not give ye,\r","it is because i do not know them yet;\r","but i shall add them in a brief appendix,\r","to come between mine epic and its inde\r","but ere he went, he added a

't,\r","and having casually glanced it through,\r","retired; and, as went out, calmly kiss'd her,\r","less like a young wife than an aged sister\r","he was a cold, good, honourable man,\r","proud of his birth, and proud of every thing;\r","a goodly spirit for a state divan,\r","a figure fit to walk before a king;\r","tall, stately, form'd to lead the courtly van\r","on birthdays, glorious with a star and string;\r","   \r","the very model of a chamberlain--\r","and such i mean to make him when i reign\r","but there was something wanting on the whole--\r","i don't know what, and therefore cannot tell--\r","which pretty women--the sweet souls!--call soul\r","certes it was not body; he was well\r","proportion'd, as a poplar or a pole,\r","a handsome man, that human miracle;\r","and in each circumstance of love or war\r","had still preserved his perpendicular\r","still there was something wanting, as i've said -\r","that undefinable 'je ne scais quoi,'\r","which, for what i know,

found, alas!\r","like archimedes, i leave earth as 'twas\r","our gentle adeline had one defect--\r","her heart was vacant, though a splendid mansion;\r","her conduct had been perfectly correct,\r","as she had seen nought claiming its expansion\r","a wavering spirit may be easier wreck'd,\r","because 'tis frailer, doubtless, than a stanch one;\r","but when the latter works its own undoing,\r","its inner crash is like an earthquake's ruin\r","she loved her lord, or thought so; but that love\r","cost her an effort, which is a sad toil,\r","the stone of sisyphus, if once we move\r","our feelings 'gainst the nature of the soil\r","she had nothing to complain of, or reprove,\r","no bickerings, no connubial turmoil:\r","their union was a model to behold,\r","serene and noble,--conjugal, but cold\r","there was no great disparity of years,\r","though much in temper; but they never clash'd:\r","they moved like stars united in their spheres,\r","or like the rhone by leman's waters wash'd,\r","where mingled and yet separate appears\r","the river from the lake, all bluely dash'd\r","through the serene and placid glassy deep,\r","which fain would lull its river-child to sleep\r","now when she once had ta'en an interest\r","in any thing, however she might flatter\r","herself that her intentions were the best,\r","intense intentions are a dangerous matter:\r","impressions were much stronger than she guess'd,\r","and gather'd as they run like growing water\r","upon her mind; the more so, as her breast\r","was not at first too readily impress'd\r","but when it was, she had that lurking demon\r","of double nature, and thus doubly named -\r","firmness yclept in heroes, kings, and seamen,\r","that is, when they succeed; but greatly

between the false and true,\r","if such can e'er be drawn by man's capacity:\r","my business is with lady adeline,\r","who in her way too was a heroine\r","she knew not her own heart; then how should i?\r","i think not she was then in love with juan:\r","if so, she would have had the strength to fly\r","the wild sensation, unto her a new one:\r","she merely felt a common sympathy\r","i will not say it was a false or true one\r","in him, because she thought he was in danger,-\r","her husband's friend, her own, young, and a stranger,\r","she was, or thought she was, his friendand this\r","without the farce of friendship, or romance\r","of platonism, which leads so oft amiss\r","ladies who have studied friendship but in france,\r","or germany, where people purely kiss\r","to thus much adeline would not advance;\r","but of such friendship as man's may to man be\r","she was as capable as woman can be\r","no doubt the secret influence of the se\r","will there, as also in the ties of blood,\r","an innocent predominance annex,\r","and tune the concord to a finer mood\r","if free from passion, which all friendship checks,\r","and your true feelings fully understood,\r","no friend like to a woman earth discovers,\r","so that you have not been nor will be lovers\r"," \r","love bears within its breast the very germ\r","of change; and how should this be otherwise?\r","that violent things more quickly find a term\r","is shown through nature's whole analogies;\r","and how should the most fierce of all be firm?\r","would you have endless lightning in the

lovers not some reason to regret\r","the passion which made solomon a zany\r","i've also seen some wives not to forget\r","the marriage state, the best or worst of any\r","who were the very paragons of wives,\r","yet made the misery of at least two lives\r","i've also seen some female friends 'tis odd,\r","but true--as, if expedient, i could prove\r","that faithful were through thick and thin,

battles,\r","despite the snake society's loud rattles\r","whether don juan and chaste adeline\r","grew friends in this or any other sense,\r","will be discuss'd hereafter, i opine:\r","at present i am glad of a pretence\r","to leave them hovering, as the effect is fine,\r","and keeps the atrocious reader in suspense;\r","the surest way for ladies and for books\r","to bait their tender, or their tenter, hooks\r","whether they rode, or walk'd, or studied spanish\r","to read don quixote in the original,\r","a pleasure before which all others vanish;\r","whether their talk was of the kind call'd 'small,'\r","or serious, are the topics i must banish\r","to the next canto; where perhaps i shall\r","say something to the purpose, and display\r","considerable talent in my way\r","above all, i beg all men to forbear\r","anticipating aught about the matter:\r","they'll only make mistakes about the fair,\r","and juan too, especially the latter\r","and i shall take a much more serious air\r","than i have yet done, in this epic satire\r","it is not clear that adeline and juan\r","will fall; but if they do, 'twill be their ruin\r","but great things spring from little:- would you think,\r","that in our youth, as dangerous a passion\r","as e'er brought man and woman to the brink\r","of ruin, rose from such a slight occasion,\r","as few would ever dream could form the link\r","of such a sentimental situation?\r","you'll never guess, i 'll bet you millions, milliards--\r","it all sprung from a harmless game at billiards\r","'tis strange,--but true; for truth is always strange;\r","stranger than fiction; if it could be told,\r","how much would novels gain by the exchange!\r","how differently the world would men behold!\r","how oft would vice and virtue places change!\r","the new world would be nothing to the old,\r","if some columbus of the moral seas\r","would show mankind their souls' antipodes\r","what 'antres vast and deserts idle' then\r","would be

hours bereft,\r","though foe to love; and yet they could not be\r","meant to grow old, but die in happy spring,\r","before one charm or hope had taken wing\r","their faces were not made for wrinkles, their\r","pure blood to stagnate, their great hearts to fail;\r","the blank grey was not made to blast their hair,\r","but like the climes that know nor snow nor hail\r","they were all summer: lightning might assail\r","and shiver them to ashes, but to trail\r","a long and snake-like life of dull decay\r","was not for them- they had too little day\r","    \r","they were alone once more; for them to be\r","thus was another eden; they were never\r","weary, unless when separate: the tree\r","cut from its forest root of years- the river\r","damm'd from its fountain- the child from the knee\r","and breast maternal wean'd at once for ever,-\r","would wither less than these two torn apart;\r","alas! there is no instinct like the heart-\r","the heart- which may be broken: happy they!\r","thrice fortunate! who of that fragile mould,\r","the precious porcelain of human clay,\r","break with the first fall: they can ne'er behold\r","the long year link'd with heavy day on

yore,\r","and many deaths do they escape by this:\r","the death of friends, and that which slays even more-\r","the death of friendship, love, youth, all that is,\r","except mere breath; and since the silent shore\r","awaits at last even those who longest miss\r","the old archer's shafts, perhaps the early grave\r","which men weep over may be meant to save\r","haidee and juan thought not of the dead-\r","the heavens, and earth, and air, seem'd made for them:\r","they found no fault with time, save that he fled;\r","they saw not in themsees aught to condemn:\r","each was the other's mirror, and but read\r","joy sparkling in their dark eyes like a gem,\r","and knew such brightness was but the reflection\r","of their exchanging glances of affection\r","the gentle pressure, and the thrilling touch,\r","the least glance better understood than words,\r","which still said all, and ne'er could say too much;\r","a language, too, but like to that of birds,\r","known but to them, at least appearing such\r","as but to lovers a true sense affords;\r","  \r","sweet playful phrases, which would seem absurd\r","to those who have ceased to hear such, or ne'er heard,-\r","all these were theirs, for they were children still,\r","and children still they should have ever been;\r","they were not made in the real world to fill\r","a busy character in the dull scene,\r","but like two beings born from out a rill,\r","a nymph and her beloved, all unseen\r","to pass their lives in fountains and on flowers,\r","and never know the weight of human hours\r","moons changing had roll'd on, and changeless found\r","those their bright rise had lighted to such joys\r","as rarely they beheld throughout their round;\r","and these were not of the vain kind which cloys,\r","for theirs were buoyant spirits, never bound\r","by the mere senses; and that which destroys\r","most love, possession, unto them appear'd\r","a thing which each endearment more endear'd\r","oh beautiful! and rare as beautiful\r","but theirs was love in which the mind delights\r","to lose itself when the old world grows dull,\r","and we are sick of its hack sounds and sights,\r","intrigues, adventures of the common school,\r","its petty passions, marriages, and flights,\r","where hymen's torch but brands one strumpet more,\r","whose husband only knows her not a wh- re\r","hard words; harsh truth; a truth which many know\r","enough- the faithful and the fairy pair,\r","who never found a single hour too slow,\r","what was it made them thus exempt from care?\r","young innate feelings all have felt below,\r","which perish in the rest, but in them were\r","inherent- what we mortals call romantic,\r","and always envy, though we deem it franti\r","this is in others a factitious state,\r","an opium dream of too much youth and reading,\r","but was in them their nature or their fate:\r","   \r","no novels e'er had set their young hearts bleeding,\r","for haidee's knowledge was by no means great,\r","and juan was a boy of saintly breeding;\r","so that there was no reason for their loves\r","more than for those of nightingales or doves\r","they gazed upon the sunset; 't is an hour\r","dear unto all, but dearest to their eyes,\r","for it had made them what they were: the power\r","of love had first o'erwhelm'd them from such skies,\r","when happiness had been their only dower,\r","and twilight saw them link'd in passion's ties;\r","charm'd with each other, all things charm'd that brought\r","the past still welcome as the present thought\r","i know not why, but in that hour to-night,\r","even as they gazed, a sudden tremor came,\r","and swept, as 't were, across their hearts' delight,\r","like the wind o'er a harp-string, or a flame,\r","when one is shook in sound, and one in sight;\r","and thus some boding flash'd through either frame,\r","and call'd from juan's breast a faint low sigh,\r","while one new tear arose in haidee's eye\r","that large black prophet eye seem'd to dilate\r","and follow far the disappearing sun,\r","as if their last day! of a happy date\r","with his broad, bright, and dropping orb were gone;\r","juan gazed on her as to ask his fate-\r","he felt a grief, but knowing cause for none,\r","his glance inquired of hers for some excuse\r","for feelings causeless, or at least abstruse\r","she turn'd to him, and smiled, but in that sort\r","which makes not others smile; then turn'd aside:\r","whatever feeling shook her, it seem'd short,\r","and master'd by her wisdom or her pride;\r","when juan spoke, too- it might be in sport-\r","of this their mutual feeling, she replied-\r","'if it should be so,- but- it cannot be-\r","or i at least shall not survive to see'\r","    \r","juan would question further, but she press'd\r","his lip to hers, and silenced him with this,\r","and then dismiss'd the omen from her breast,\r","defying augury with that fond kiss;\r","and no doubt of all methods 't is the best:\r","some people prefer wine- 't is not amiss;\r","i have tried both; so those who would a part take\r","may choose between the headache and the heartache\r","one of the two, according to your choice,\r","woman or wine, you 'll have to undergo;\r","both maladies are taxes on our joys:\r","but which to choose, i really hardly know;\r","and if i had to give a casting voice,\r","for both sides i could many reasons show,\r","and then decide, without great wrong to either,\r","it were much better to have both than neither\r","juan and haidee gazed upon each other\r","with swimming looks of speechless tenderness,\r","which mix'd all feelings, friend, child, lover, brother,\r","all that the best can mingle and express\r","when two pure hearts are pour'd in one another,\r","and love too much, and yet can not love less;\r","but almost sanctify the sweet excess\r","by the immortal wish and power to bless\r","mix'd in each other's arms, and heart in heart,\r","why did they not then die?- they had lived too long\r","should an hour come to bid them breathe apart;\r","years could but bring them cruel things or wrong;\r","the world was not for them, nor the world's art\r","for beings passionate as sappho's song;\r","love was born with them, in them, so intense,\r","it was their very spirit- not a sense\r","they should have lived together deep in woods,\r","unseen as sings the nightingale; they were\r","unfit to mix in these thick solitudes\r","call'd social, haunts of hate, and vice, and care:\r","how lonely every freeborn creature broods!\r","the sweetest song-birds nestle in a pair;\r","    \r","the eagle soars alone; the gull and crow\r","flock o'er their carrion, just like men below\r","now pillow'd cheek to cheek, in loving sleep,\r","haidee and juan their siesta took,\r","a gentle slumber, but it was not deep,\r","for ever and anon a something shook\r","juan, and shuddering o'er his frame would creep;\r","and haidee's sweet lips murmur'd like a brook\r","a wordless music, and her face so fair\r","stirr'd with her dream, as rose-leaves with the air\r","or as the stirring of a deep dear stream\r","within an alpine hollow, when the wind\r","walks o'er it, was she shaken by the dream,\r","the mystical usurper of the mind-\r","o'erpowering us to be whate'er may seem\r","good to the soul which we no more can bind;\r","strange state of being! for 't is still to be\r","senseless to feel, and with seal'd eyes to see\r","she dream'd of being alone on the sea-shore,\r","chain'd to a rock; she knew not how, but stir\r","she could not from the spot, and the loud roar\r","grew, and each wave rose roughly, threatening her;\r","and o'er her upper lip they seem'd to pour,\r","until she sobb'd for breath, and soon they were\r","foaming o'er her lone head, so fierce and high-\r","each broke to drown her, yet she could not die\r","anon- she was released, and then she stray'd\r","o'er the sharp shingles with her bleeding feet,\r","and stumbled almost every step she made;\r","and something roll'd before her in a sheet,\r","which she must still pursue howe'er afraid:\r","'t was white and indistinct, nor stopp'd to meet\r","her glance nor grasp, for still she gazed, and grasp'd,\r","and ran, but it escaped her as she clasp'd\r","the dream changed:- in a cave she stood, its walls\r","were hung with marble icicles, the work\r","of ages on its water-fretted halls,\r","   \r","where waves might wash, and seals might breed and lurk;\r","her hair was dripping, and the very balls\r","of her black eyes seem'd turn'd to tears, and mirk\r","the sharp rocks look'd below each drop they caught,\r","which froze to marble as it fell,- she thought\r","and wet, and cold, and lifeless at her feet,\r","pale as the foam that froth'd on his dead brow,\r","which she essay'd in vain to clear how sweet\r","were once her cares, how idle seem'd they now!,\r","lay juan, nor could aught renew the beat\r","of his quench'd heart; and the sea dirges low\r","rang in her sad ears like a mermaid's song,\r","and that brief dream appear'd a life too long\r","and gazing on the dead, she thought his face\r","faded, or alter'd into something new-\r","like to her father's features, till each trace-\r","more like and like to lambro's aspect grew-\r","with all his keen worn look and grecian grace;\r","and starting, she awoke, and what to view?\r","oh! powers of heaven! what dark eye meets she there?\r","'t is- 't is her father's- fix'd upon the pair!\r","then shrieking, she arose, and shrieking fell,\r","with joy and sorrow, hope and fear, to see\r","him whom she deem'd a habitant where dwell\r","the ocean-buried, risen from death, to be\r","perchance the death of one she loved too well:\r","dear as her father had been to haidee,\r","it was a moment of that awful kind-\r","i have seen such- but must not call to mind\r","up juan sprung to haidee's bitter shriek,\r","and caught her falling, and from off the wall\r","snatch'd down his sabre, in hot haste to wreak\r","vengeance on him who was the cause of all:\r","then lambro, who till now forbore to speak,\r","smiled scornfully, and said, 'within my call,\r","a thousand scimitars await the word;\r","put up, young man, put up your silly sword'\r","   \r","and haidee clung around him; 'juan, 't is-\r","'t is lambro- 't is my father! kneel with me-\r","he will forgive us- yes- it must be- yes\r","oh! dearest father, in this agony\r","of pleasure and of pain- even while i kiss\r","thy garment's hem with transport, can it be\r","that doubt should mingle with my filial joy?\r","deal with me as thou wilt, but spare this boy'\r","high and inscrutable the old man stood,\r","calm in his voice, and calm within his eye-\r","not always signs with him of calmest mood:\r","he look'd upon her, but gave no reply;\r","then turn'd to juan, in whose cheek the blood\r","oft came and went, as there resoed to die;\r","in arms, at least, he stood, in act to spring\r","on the first foe whom lambro's call might bring\r","'young man, your sword;' so lambro once more said:\r","juan replied, 'not while this arm is free'\r","the old man's cheek grew pale, but not with dread,\r","and drawing from his belt a pistol, he\r","replied, 'your blood be then on your own head'\r","then look'd dose at the flint, as if to see\r","'t was fresh- for he had lately used the lock-\r","and next proceeded quietly to cock\r","it has a strange quick jar upon the ear,\r","that cocking of a pistol, when you know\r","a moment more will bring the sight to bear\r","upon your person, twee yards off, or so;\r","a gentlemanly distance, not too near,\r","if you have got a former friend for foe;\r","but after being fired at once or twice,\r","the ear becomes more irish, and less nice\r","lambro presented, and one instant more\r","had stopp'd this canto, and don juan's breath,\r","when haidee threw herself her boy before;\r","stern as her sire: 'on me,' she cried, 'let death\r","descend- the fault is mine; this fatal shore\r","he found- but sought not i have pledged my faith;\r","     \r","i love him- i will die with him: i knew\r","your nature's firmness- know your daughter's too'\r","a minute past, and she had been all tears,\r","and tenderness, and infancy; but now\r","she stood as one who champion'd human fears-\r","pale, statue-like, and stern, she woo'd the blow;\r","and tall beyond her sex, and their compeers,\r","she drew up to her height, as if to show\r","a fairer mark; and with a fix'd eye scann'd\r","her father's face- but never stopp'd his hand\r","he gazed on her, and she on him; 't was strange\r","how like they look'd! the expression was the same;\r","serenely savage, with a little change\r","in the large dark eye's mutual-darted flame;\r","for she, too, was as one who could avenge,\r","if cause should be- a lioness, though tame\r","her father's blood before her father's face\r","boil'd up, and proved her truly of his race\r","i said they were alike, their features and\r","their stature, differing but in sex and years;\r","even to the delicacy of their hand\r","there was resemblance, such as true blood wears;\r","and now to see them, thus divided, stand\r","in fix'd ferocity, when joyous tears\r","and sweet sensations should have welcomed both,\r","show what the passions are in their full growth\r","the father paused a moment, then withdrew\r","his weapon, and replaced it; but stood still,\r","and looking on her, as to look her through,\r","'not i,' he said, 'have sought this stranger's ill;\r","not i have made this desolation: few\r","would bear such outrage, and forbear to kill;\r","but i must do my duty- how thou hast\r","done thine, the present vouches for the past\r","'let him disarm; or, by my father's head,\r","his own shall roll before you like a ball!'\r","he raised his whistle, as the word he said,\r","and blew; another answer'd to the call,\r","and rushing in disorderly, though led,\r","and arm'd from boot to turban, one and all,\r","some twenty of his train came, rank on rank;\r","he gave the word,- 'arrest or slay the frank'\r","then, with a sudden movement, he withdrew\r","his daughter; while compress'd within his clasp,\r","'twixt her and juan interposed the crew;\r","in vain she struggled in her father's grasp-\r","his arms were like a serpent's coil: then flew\r","upon their prey, as darts an angry asp,\r","the file of pirates; save the foremost, who\r","had fallen, with his right shoulder half cut through\r","the second had his cheek laid open; but\r","the third, a wary, cool old sworder, took\r","the blows upon his cutlass, and then put\r","his own well in; so well, ere you could look,\r","his man was floor'd, and helpless at his foot,\r","with the blood running like a little brook\r","from two smart sabre gashes, deep and red-\r","one on the arm, the other on the head\r","and then they bound him where he fell, and bore\r","juan from the apartment: with a sign\r","old lambro bade them take him to the shore,\r","where lay some ships which were to sail at nine\r","they laid him in a boat, and plied the oar\r","until they reach'd some galliots, placed in line;\r","on board of one of these, and under hatches,\r","they stow'd him, with strict orders to the watches\r","the world is full of strange vicissitudes,\r","and here was one exceedingly unpleasant:\r","a gentleman so rich in the world's goods,\r","handsome and young, enjoying all the present,\r","just at the very time when he least broods\r","on such a thing is suddenly to sea sent,\r","wounded and chain'd, so that he cannot move,\r","and all because a lady fell in love\r"," \r","here i must leave him, for i grow pathetic,\r","moved by the chinese nymph of tears, green tea!\r","than whom cassandra was not more prophetic;\r","for if my pure libations exceed three,\r","i feel my heart become so sympathetic,\r","that i must have recourse to black bohea:\r","'t is pity wine should be so deleterious,\r","for tea and coffee leave us much more serious,\r","unless when qualified with thee, cogniac!\r","sweet naiad of the phlegethontic rill!\r","ah! why the liver wilt thou thus attack,\r","and make, like other nymphs, thy lovers ill?\r","i would take refuge in weak punch, but rack\r","in each sense of the word, whene'er i fill\r","my mild and midnight beakers to the brim,\r","wakes me next morning with its synonym\r","i leave don juan for the present, safe-\r","not sound, poor fellow, but severely wounded;\r","yet could his corporal pangs amount to half\r","of those with which his haidee's bosom bounded?\r","she was not one to weep, and rave, and chafe,\r","and then give way, subdued because surrounded;\r","her mother was a moorish maid, from fez,\r","where all is eden, or a wilderness\r","there the large olive rains its amber store\r","in marble fonts; there grain, and flower, and fruit,\r","gush from the earth until the land runs o'er;\r","but there, too, many a poison-tree has root,\r","and midnight listens to the lion's roar,\r","and long, long deserts scorch the camel's foot,\r","or heaving whelm the helpless caravan;\r","and as the soil is, so the heart of man\r","afric is all the sun's, and as her earth\r","her human day is kindled; full of power\r","for good or evil, burning from its birth,\r","the moorish blood partakes the planet's hour,\r","and like the soil beneath it will bring forth:\r","beauty and love were haidee's mother's dower;\r","but her large dark eye show'd deep passion's force,\r","though sleeping like a lion near a source\r","her daughter, temper'd with a milder ray,\r","like summer clouds all siery, smooth, and fair,\r","till slowly charged with thunder they display\r","terror to earth, and tempest to the air,\r","had held till now her soft and milky way;\r","but overwrought with passion and despair,\r","the fire burst forth from her numidian veins,\r","even as the simoom sweeps the blasted plains\r","the last sight which she saw was juan's gore,\r","and he himself o'ermaster'd and cut down;\r","his blood was running on the very floor\r","where late he trod, her beautiful, her own;\r","thus much she view'd an instant and no more,-\r","her struggles ceased with one convulsive groan;\r","on her sire's arm, which until now scarce held\r","her writhing, fell she like a cedar fell'd\r","a vein had burst, and her sweet lips' pure dyes\r","were dabbled with the deep blood which ran o'er;\r","and her head droop'd as when the lily lies\r","o'ercharged with rain: her summon'd handmaids bore\r","their lady to her couch with gushing eyes;\r","of herbs and cordials they produced their store,\r","but she defied all means they could employ,\r","like one life could not hold, nor death destroy\r","days lay she in that state unchanged, though chill-\r","with nothing livid, still her lips were red;\r","she had no pulse, but death seem'd absent still;\r","no hideous sign proclaim'd her surely dead;\r","corruption came not in each mind to kill\r","all hope; to look upon her sweet face bred\r","new thoughts of life, for it seem'd full of soul-\r","she had so much, earth could not claim the whole\r","the ruling passion, such as marble shows\r","when exquisitely chisell'd, still lay there,\r","but fix'd as marble's unchanged aspect throws\r","o'er the fair venus, but for ever fair;\r","o'er the laocoon's all eternal throes,\r","and ever-dying gladiator's air,\r","their energy like life forms all their fame,\r","yet looks not life, for they are still the same\r","she woke at length, but not as sleepers wake,\r","rather the dead, for life seem'd something new,\r","a strange sensation which she must partake\r","perforce, since whatsoever met her view\r","struck not on memory, though a heavy ache\r","lay at her heart, whose earliest beat still true\r","brought back the sense of pain without the cause,\r","for, for a while, the furies made a pause\r","she look'd on many a face with vacant eye,\r","on many a token without knowing what;\r","she saw them watch her without asking why,\r","and reck'd not who around her pillow sat;\r","not speechless, though she spoke not; not a sigh\r","relieved her thoughts; dull silence and quick chat\r","were tried in vain by those who served; she gave\r","no sign, save breath, of having left the grave\r","her handmaids tended, but she heeded not;\r","her father watch'd, she turn'd her eyes away;\r","she recognized no being, and no spot,\r","however dear or cherish'd in their day;\r","they changed from room to room- but all forgot-\r","gentle, but without memory she lay;\r","at length those eyes, which they would fain be weaning\r","back to old thoughts, wax'd full of fearful meaning\r","and then a slave bethought her of a harp;\r","the harper came, and tuned his instrument;\r","at the first notes, irregular and sharp,\r","on him her flashing eyes a moment bent,\r","then to the wall she turn'd as if to warp\r","her thoughts from sorrow through her heart re-sent;\r","and he begun a long low island song\r","of ancient days, ere tyranny grew strong\r","  \r","anon her thin wan fingers beat the wall\r","in time to his old tune; he changed the theme,\r","and sung of love; the fierce name struck through all\r","her recollection; on her flash'd the dream\r","of what she was, and is, if ye could call\r","to be so being; in a gushing stream\r","the tears rush'd forth from her o'erclouded brain,\r","like mountain mists at length dissoed in rain\r","short solace, vain reliefthought came too quick,\r","and whirl'd her brain to madness; she arose\r","as one who ne'er had dwelt among the sick,\r","and flew at all she met, as on her foes;\r","but no one ever heard her speak or shriek,\r","although her paroxysm drew towards its dose;-\r","hers was a phrensy which disdain'd to rave,\r","even when they smote her, in the hope to save\r","yet she betray'd at times a gleam of sense;\r","nothing could make her meet her father's face,\r","though on all other things with looks intense\r","she gazed, but none she ever could retrace;\r","food she refused, and raiment; no pretence\r","avail'd for either; neither change of place,\r","nor time, nor skill, nor remedy, could give her\r","senses to sleep- the power seem'd gone for ever\r","twee days and nights she wither'd thus; at last,\r","without a groan, or sigh, or glance, to show\r","a parting pang, the spirit from her past:\r","and they who watch'd her nearest could not know\r","the very instant, till the change that cast\r","her sweet face into shadow, dull and slow,\r","glazed o'er her eyes- the beautiful, the black-\r","oh! to possess such lustre- and then lack!\r","she died, but not alone; she held within\r","a second principle of life, which might\r","have dawn'd a fair and sinless child of sin;\r","but closed its little being without light,\r","and went down to the grave unborn, wherein\r","blossom and bough lie wither'd with one blight;\r","in vain the dews of heaven descend above\r","the bleeding flower and blasted fruit of love\r","thus lived- thus died she; never more on her\r","shall sorrow light, or shame she was not made\r","through years or moons the inner weight to bear,\r","which colder hearts endure till they are laid\r","by age in earth: her days and pleasures were\r","brief, but delightful- such as had not staid\r","long with her destiny; but she sleeps well\r","by the sea-shore, whereon she loved to dwell\r","that isle is now all desolate and bare,\r","its dwellings down, its tenants pass'd away;\r","none but her own and father's grave is there,\r","and nothing outward tells of human clay;\r","ye could not know where lies a thing so fair,\r","no stone is there to show, no tongue to say\r","what was; no dirge, except the hollow sea's,\r","mourns o'er the beauty of the cyclades\r","but many a greek maid in a loving song\r","sighs o'er her name; and many an islander\r","with her sire's story makes the night less long;\r","valour was his, and beauty dwelt with her:\r","if she loved rashly, her life paid for wrong-\r","a heavy price must all pay who thus err,\r","in some shape; let none think to fly the danger,\r","for soon or late love is his own avenger\r","but let me change this theme which grows too sad,\r","and lay this sheet of sorrows on the shelf;\r","i don't much like describing people mad,\r","for fear of seeming rather touch'd myself-\r","besides, i 've no more on this head to add;\r","and as my muse is a capricious elf,\r","we 'll put about, and try another tack\r","with juan, left half-kill'd some stanzas back\r","wounded and fetter'd, 'cabin'd, cribb'd, confined,'\r","some days and nights elapsed before that he\r","could altogether call the past to mind;\r","and when he did, he found himself at sea,\r","sailing six knots an hour before the wind;\r","the shores of ilion lay beneath their lee-\r","another time he might have liked to see 'em,\r","but now was not much pleased with cape sigaeum\r","there, on the green and village-cotted hill, is\r","flank'd by the hellespont and by the sea\r","entomb'd the bravest of the brave, achilles;\r","they say so bryant says the contrary:\r","and further downward, tall and towering still, is\r","the tumulus- of whom? heaven knows! 't may be\r","patroclus, ajax, or protesilaus-\r","all heroes, who if living still would slay us\r","high barrows, without marble or a name,\r","a vast, untill'd, and mountain-skirted plain,\r","and ida in the distance, still the same,\r","and old scamander if 't is he remain;\r","the situation seems still form'd for fame-\r","a hundred thousand men might fight again\r","with case;

despatch, forgot to break the seal\r","then recollecting the whole empress, nor\r","forgetting quite the woman which composed\r","at least three parts of this great whole, she tore\r","the letter open with an air which posed\r","the court, that watch'd each look her visage wore,\r","until a royal smile at length disclosed\r","fair weather for the day though rather spacious,\r","her face was noble, her eyes fine, mouth gracious\r","great joy was hers, or rather joys: the first\r","was a ta'en city, thirty thousand slain\r","glory and triumph o'er her aspect burst,\r","as an east indian sunrise on the main\r","these quench'd a moment her ambition's thirst--\r","so arab deserts drink in summer's rain:\r","in vainas fall the dews on quenchless sands,\r","blood only serves to wash ambition's hands!\r","her next amusement was more fanciful;\r","she smiled at mad suwarrow's rhymes, who threw\r","into a russian couplet rather dull\r","the whole gazette of thousands whom he slew\r","her third was feminine enough to annul\r","the shudder which runs naturally through\r","our veins, when things call'd sovereigns think it best\r","to kill, and generals turn it into jest\r","the two first feelings ran their course complete,\r","and lighted first her eye, and then her mouth:\r","the whole court look'd immediately most sweet,\r","  \r","like flowers well water'd after a long drouth\r","but when on the lieutenant at her feet\r","her majesty, who liked to gaze on youth\r","almost as much as on a new despatch,\r","glanced mildly, all the world was on the watch\r","though somewhat large, exuberant, and truculent,\r","when wroth- while pleased, she was as fine a figure\r","as those who like things rosy, ripe, and succulent,\r","would wish to look on, while they are in vigour\r","she could repay each amatory look you lent\r","with interest, and in turn was wont with rigour\r","to exact of cupid's bills the full amount\r","at sight, nor would permit you to discount\r","with her the latter, though at times convenient,\r","was not so necessary; for they tell\r","that she was handsome, and though fierce look'd lenient,\r","and always used her favourites too well\r","if once beyond her boudoir's precincts in ye went,\r","your 'fortune' was in a fair way 'to swell\r","a man' as giles says; for though she would widow all\r","nations, she liked man as an individual\r","what a strange thing is man? and what a stranger\r","is woman! what a whirlwind is her head,\r","and what a whirlpool full of depth and danger\r","is all the rest about her! whether wed\r","or widow, maid or mother, she can change her\r","mind like the wind: whatever she has said\r","or done, is light to what she'll say or do;--\r","the oldest thing on record, and yet new!\r","oh catherine! for of all interjections,\r","to thee both oh! and ah! belong of right\r","in love and war how odd are the connections\r","of human thoughts, which jostle in their flight!\r","just now yours were cut out in different sections:\r","first ismail's capture caught your fancy quite;\r","next of new knights, the fresh and glorious batch;\r","and thirdly he who brought you the

'heaven-kissing'\r","her majesty look'd down, the youth look'd up--\r","and so they fell in love;--she with his face,\r","his grace, his god-knows-what: for cupid's cup\r","with the first draught intoxicates apace,\r","a quintessential laudanum or 'black drop,'\r","which makes one drunk at once, without the base\r","expedient of full bumpers; for the eye\r","in love drinks all life's fountains

fashion,\r","or duchess, princess, empress, 'deigns to prove'\r","'tis pope's phrase a great longing, though a rash one,\r","for one especial person out of many,\r","makes us believe oursees as good as any\r","besides, he was of that delighted age\r","which makes all female ages equal--when\r","we don't much care with whom we may engage,\r","as bold as daniel in the lion's den,\r","so that we can our native sun assuage\r","in the next ocean, which may flow just then,\r","to make a twilight in, just as sol's heat is\r","quench'd in the lap of the salt sea, or thetis\r","and catherine we must say thus much for catherine,\r","though bold and bloody, was the kind of thing\r","whose temporary passion was quite flattering,\r","because each lover look'd a sort of king,\r","made up upon an amatory pattern,\r","a royal husband in all save the ring--\r","    \r","which, being the damn'dest part of matrimony,\r","seem'd taking out the sting to leave the honey\r","and when you add to this, her womanhood\r","in its meridian, her blue eyes or gray\r","the last, if they have soul, are quite as good,\r","or better, as the best examples say:\r","napoleon's, mary's queen of scotland, should\r","lend to that colour a transcendent ray;\r","and pallas also sanctions the same hue,\r","too wise to look through optics black or blue--\r","her sweet smile, and her then majestic figure,\r","her plumpness, her imperial condescension,\r","her preference of a boy to men much bigger\r","fellows whom messalina's self would pension,\r","her prime of life, just now in juicy vigour,\r","with other extras, which we need not mention,--\r","all these, or any one of these, explain\r","enough to make a stripling very vain\r","and that's enough, for love is vanity,\r","selfish in its beginning as its end,\r","except where 't is a mere insanity,\r","a maddening spirit which would strive to blend\r","itself with beauty's frail inanity,\r","on which the passion's self seems to depend:\r","and hence some heathenish philosophers\r","make love the main spring of the universe\r","besides platonic love, besides the love\r","of god, the love of sentiment, the loving\r","of faithful pairs i needs must rhyme with dove,\r","that good old steam-boat which keeps verses moving\r","'gainst reason--reason ne'er was hand-and-glove\r","with rhyme, but always leant less to improving\r","the sound than sense--beside all these pretences\r","to love, there are those things which words name senses;\r","those movements, those improvements in our bodies\r","which make all bodies anxious to get out\r","of their own sand-pits, to mix with a goddess,\r","    \r","for such all women are at first no doubt\r","how beautiful that moment! and how odd is\r","that fever which precedes the languid rout\r","of our sensations! what a curious way\r","the whole thing is of clothing souls in clay!\r","the noblest kind of love is love platonical,\r","to end or to begin with; the next grand\r","is that which may be christen'd love canonical,\r","because the clergy take the thing in hand;\r","the third sort to be noted in our chronicle\r","as flourishing in every christian land,\r","is when chaste matrons to their other ties\r","add what may be call'd marriage in disguise\r","well, we won't analyse--our story must\r","tell for itself: the sovereign was smitten,\r","juan much flatter'd by her love, or lust;-\r","i cannot stop to alter words once written,\r","and the two are so mix'd with human dust,\r","that he who names one, both perchance may hit on:\r","but in such

wrinkles curl'd much crisper\r","as they beheld; the younger cast some leers\r","on one another, and each lovely lisper\r","smiled as she talk'd the matter o'er; but tears\r","of rivalship rose in each clouded eye\r","of all the standing army who stood by\r","all the ambassadors of all the powers\r","enquired, who was this very new young man,\r","who promised to be great in some few hours?\r","which is full soon--though life is but a span\r","already they beheld the sier showers\r","of rubles rain, as fast as specie can,\r","upon his cabinet, besides the presents\r","of several

banner\r","an order from her majesty consign'd\r","our young lieutenant to the genial care\r","of those in office: all the world look'd kind\r","as it will look sometimes with the first stare,\r","which youth would not act ill to keep in mind,\r","as also did miss protasoff then there,\r","  \r","named from her mystic office 'l'eprouveuse,'\r","a term inexplicable to the muse\r","with her then, as in humble duty bound,\r","juan retired,--and so will i, until\r","my pegasus shall tire of touching ground\r","we have just lit on a 'heaven-kissing hill,'\r","so lofty that i feel my brain turn round,\r","and all my fancies whirling like a mill;\r","which is a signal to my nerves and brain,\r","to take a quiet ride in some green lane\r","\r","don juan: canto the second\r"," the ship, call'd the most holy \"trinidada,\"\r","   was steering duly for the port leghorn;\r","for there the spanish family moncada\r","   were settled long ere juan's sire was born:\r","they were relations, and for them he had a\r","   letter of introduction, which the morn\r","of his departure had been sent him by\r","his spanish friends for those in i\r","his suite consisted of three servants and\r","  a tutor, the licentiate pedrillo,\r","who several languages did understand,\r","  but now lay sick and speechless on his pillow,\r","and, rocking in his hammock, long'd for land,\r","  his headache being increas'd by every billow;\r","and the waves oozing through the port-hole made\r","his berth a little damp, and him i\r","'twas not without some reason, for the wind\r","  increas'd at night, until it blew a gale;\r","and though 'twas not much to a naval mind,\r","  some landsmen would have look'd a little pale,\r","for sailors are, in fact, a different kind:\r","  at sunset they began to take in sail,\r","for the sky show'd it would come on to blow,\r","and carry away, perhaps, a mast or \r","at one o'clock the wind with sudden shift\r","  threw the ship right into the trough of the sea,\r","which struck her aft, and made an awkward rift,\r","  started the stern-post, also shatter'd the\r","whole of her stern-frame, and, ere she could lift\r","  herself from out her present jeopardy,\r","the rudder tore away: 'twas time to sound\r","the pumps, and there were four feet water i\r","one gang of people instantly was put\r","  upon the pumps, and the remainder set\r","to get up part of the cargo, and what not,\r","  but they could not come at the leak as yet;\r","at last they did get at it really, but\r","  still their saation was an even bet:\r","the water rush'd through in a way quite puzzling,\r","while they thrust sheets, shirts, jackets, bales of muslin,\r","into the opening; but all such ingredients\r","  would have been vain, and they must have gone down,\r","despite of all their efforts and expedients,\r","  but for the pumps: i'm glad to make them known\r","to all the brother tars who may have need hence,\r","  for fifty tons of water were upthrown\r","by them per hour, and they had all been undone,\r","but for the maker, mr mann, of\r","as day advanc'd the weather seem'd to abate,\r","  and then the leak they reckon'd to reduce,\r","and keep the ship afloat, though three feet yet\r","  kept two hand- and one chain-pump still in use\r","the wind blew fresh again: as it grew late\r","  a squall came on, and while some guns broke loose,\r","a gust--which all descriptive power transcends--\r","laid with one blast the ship on her beam i\r","there she lay, motionless, and seem'd upset;\r","  the water left the hold, and wash'd the decks,\r","and made a scene men do not soon forget;\r","   for they remember battles, fires and wrecks,\r","or any other thing that brings regret,\r","  or breaks their hopes, or hearts, or heads, or necks:\r","thus drownings are much talked of by the divers\r","and swimmers who may chance to be \r","           \r","immediately the masts were cut away,\r","  both main and mizen; first the mizen went,\r","the mainmast follow'd: but the ship still lay\r","  like a mere log, and baffled our intent\r","foremast and bowsprit were cut down, and they\r","  eas'd her at last although we never meant\r","to part with all till every hope was blighted,\r","and then with violence the old ship i\r","it may be easily suppos'd, while this\r","  was going on, some people were unquiet,\r","that passengers would find it much amiss\r","  to lose their lives, as well as spoil their diet;\r","that even the able seaman, deeming his\r","  days nearly o'er, might be dispos'd to riot,\r","as upon such occasions tars will ask\r","for grog, and sometimes drink rum from the \r","there's nought, no doubt, so much the spirit calms\r","  as rum and true religion: thus it was,\r","some plunder'd, some drank spirits, some sung psalms,\r","  the high wind made the treble, and as bass\r","the hoarse harsh waves kept time; fright cur'd the qualms\r","  of all the luckless landsmen's sea-sick maws:\r","strange sounds of wailing, blasphemy, devotion,\r","clamour'd in chorus to the roaring\r","perhaps more mischief had been done, but for\r","  our juan, who, with sense beyond his years,\r","got to the spirit-room, and stood before\r","  it with a pair of pistols; and their fears,\r","as if death were more dreadful by his door\r","  of fire than water, spite of oaths and tears,\r","kept still aloof the crew, who, ere they sunk,\r","thought it would be becoming to die i\r","     \r"," \"give us more grog,\" they cried, \"for it will be\r","   all one an hour hence\" juan answer'd, \"no!\r","'tis true that death awaits both you and me,\r","  but let us die like men, not sink below\r","like brutes\"--and thus his dangerous post kept he,\r","  and none lik'd to anticipate the blow;\r","and even pedrillo, his most reverend tutor,\r","was for some rum a disappointed \r","the good old gentleman was quite aghast,\r"," and made a loud and pious lamentation;\r","repented all his sins, and made a last\r"," irrevocable vow of reformation;\r","nothing should tempt him more this peril past\r"," to quit his academic occupation,\r","in cloisters of the classic salamanca,\r","to follow juan's wake, like sancho i\r","but now there came a flash of hope once more;\r"," day broke, and the wind lull'd: the masts were gone,\r","the leak increas'd; shoals round her, but no shore,\r"," the vessel swam, yet still she held her own\r","they tried the pumps again, and though, before,\r"," their desperate efforts seem'd all useless grown,\r","a glimpse of sunshine set some hands to bale--\r","the stronger pump'd, the weaker thrumm'd a i\r","under the vessel's keel the sail was pass'd,\r","  and for the moment it had some effect;\r","but with a leak, and not a stick of mast,\r","  nor rag of canvas, what could they expect?\r","but still 'tis best to struggle to the last,\r","  'tis never too late to be wholly wreck'd:\r","and though 'tis true that man can only die once,\r","'tis not so pleasant in the gulf of\r","there winds and waves had hurl'd them, and from thence,\r"," without their will, they carried them away;\r","   \r","for they were forc'd with steering to dispense,\r"," and never had as yet a quiet day\r","on which they might repose, or even commence\r"," a jurymast or rudder, or could say\r","the ship would swim an hour, which, by good luck,\r","still swam--though not exactly like a i\r","the wind, in fact, perhaps was rather less,\r"," but the ship labour'd so, they scarce could hope\r","to weather out much longer; the distress\r"," was also great with which they had to cope\r","for want of water, and their solid mess\r"," was scant enough: in vain the telescope\r","was us'd--nor sail nor shore appear'd in sight,\r","nought but the heavy sea, and coming \r","again the weather threaten'd, again blew\r"," a gale, and in the fore and after-hold\r","water appear'd; yet, though the people knew\r"," all this, the most were patient, and some bold,\r","until the chains and leathers were worn through\r"," of all our pumps--a wreck complete she roll'd,\r","at mercy of the waves, whose mercies are\r","like human beings during civil i\r","then came the carpenter, at last, with tears\r"," in his rough eyes, and told the captain he\r","could do no more: he was a man in years,\r"," and long had voyag'd through many a stormy sea,\r","and if he wept at length they were not fears\r"," that made his eyelids as a woman's be,\r","but he, poor fellow, had a wife and children,\r","two things for dying people quite \r","the ship was evidently settling now\r"," fast by the head; and, all distinction gone,\r","some went to prayers again, and made a vow\r"," of candles to their saints--but there were none\r","     \r","to pay them with; and some looked o'er the bow;\r"," some hoisted out the boats; and there was one\r","that begg'd pedrillo for an absolution,\r","who told him to be damn'd--in his\r","some lash'd them in their hammocks; some put on\r"," their best clothes, as if going to a fair;\r","some curs'd the day on which they saw the sun,\r"," and gnash'd their teeth, and, howling, tore their hair;\r","and others went on as they had begun,\r"," getting the boats out, being well aware\r","that a tight boat will live in a rough sea,\r","unless with breakers close beneath her i\r","the worst of all was, that in their condition,\r"," having been several days in great distress,\r","'twas difficult to get out such provision\r"," as now might render their long suffering less:\r","men, even when dying, dislike inanition;\r"," their stock was damag'd by the weather's stress:\r","two casks of biscuit, and a keg of butter,\r","were all that could be thrown into the \r","but in the long-boat they contriv'd to stow\r"," some pounds of bread, though injur'd by the wet;\r","water, a twenty-gallon cask or so;\r"," six flasks of wine; and they contriv'd to get\r","a portion of their beef up from below,\r"," and with a piece of pork, moreover, met,\r","but scarce enough to serve them for a luncheon--\r","then there was rum, eight gallons in a i\r","the other boats, the yawl and pinnace, had\r"," been stove in the beginning of the gale;\r","and the long-boat's condition was but bad,\r"," as there were but two blankets for a sail,\r","and one oar for a mast, which a young lad\r"," threw in by good luck over the ship's rail;\r","     \r","and two boats could not hold, far less be stor'd,\r","to save one half the people then on i\r","'twas twilight, and the sunless day went down\r"," over the waste of waters; like a veil,\r","which, if withdrawn, would but disclose the frown\r"," of one whose hate is mask'd but to assail\r","thus to their hopeless eyes the night was shown,\r"," and grimly darkled o'er the faces pale,\r","and the dim desolate deep: twee days had fear\r","been their familiar, and now death was herel\r","some trial had been making at a raft,\r"," with little hope in such a rolling sea,\r","a sort of thing at which one would have laugh'd,\r"," if any laughter at such times could be,\r","unless with people who too much have quaff'd,\r"," and have a kind of wild and horrid glee,\r","half epileptical, and half hysterical--\r","their preservation would have been a miracleli\r","at half-past eight o'clock, booms, hencoops, spars,\r"," and all things, for a chance, had been cast loose,\r","that still could keep afloat the struggling tars,\r"," for yet they strove, although of no great use:\r","there was no light in heaven but a few stars,\r"," the boats put off o'ercrowded with their crews;\r","she gave a heel, and then a lurch to port,\r","and, going down head foremost--sunk, in shortl\r","then rose from sea to sky the wild farewell,\r"," then shriek'd the timid, and stood still the brave,\r","then some leap'd overboard with dreadful yell,\r"," as eager to anticipate their grave;\r","and the sea yawn'd around her like a hell,\r"," and down she suck'd with her the whirling wave,\r","like one who grapples with his enemy,\r","and strives to strangle him before he dieli\r"," \r","and first one universal shriek there rush'd,\r"," louder than the loud ocean, like a crash\r","of echoing thunder; and then all was hush'd,\r"," save the wild wind and the remorseless dash\r","of billows; but at intervals there gush'd,\r"," accompanied by a convulsive splash,\r","a solitary shriek, the bubbling cry\r","of some strong swimmer in his agonyl\r","the boats, as stated, had got off before,\r"," and in them crowded several of the crew;\r","and yet their present hope was hardly more\r"," than what it had been, for so strong it blew\r","there was slight chance of reaching any shore;\r"," and then they were too many, though so few--\r","nine in the cutter, thirty in the boat,\r","were counted in them when they got\r","all the rest perish'd; near two hundred souls\r","  had left their bodies; and what's worse, alas!\r","when over catholics the ocean rolls,\r","  they must wait several weeks before a mass\r","takes off one peck of purgatorial coals,\r","  because, till people know what's come to pass,\r","they won't lay out their money on the dead--\r","it costs three francs for every mass that's i\r","juan got into the long-boat, and there\r","  contriv'd to help pedrillo to a place;\r","if seem'd as if they had exchang'd their care,\r","  for juan wore the magisterial face\r","which courage gives, while poor pedrillo's pair\r","  of eyes were crying for their owner's case:\r","battista, though a name called shortly tita,\r","was lost by getting at some \r","    \r","pedro, his valet, too, he tried to save,\r"," but the same cause, conducive to his loss,\r","left him so drunk, he jump'd into the wave,\r"," as o'er the cutter's edge he tried to cross,\r","and so he found a wine-and-watery grave;\r"," they could not rescue him although so close,\r","because the sea ran higher every minute,\r","and for the boat--the crew kept crowding in i\r","a small old spaniel--which had been don jose's,\r"," his father's, whom he lov'd, as ye may think,\r","for on such things the memory reposes\r"," with tenderness--stood howling on the brink,\r","knowing dogs have such intellectual noses!,\r"," no doubt, the vessel was about to sink;\r","and juan caught him up, and ere he stepp'd\r"," off threw him in, then after him he leap'dli\r","he also stuff'd his money where he could\r"," about his person, and pedrillo's too,\r","who let him do, in fact, whate'er he would,\r"," not knowing what himself to say, or do,\r","as every rising wave his dread renew'd;\r"," but juan, trusting they might still get through,\r","and deeming there were remedies for any ill,\r","thus re-embark'd his tutor and his\r","'twas a rough night, and blew so stiffly yet,\r"," that the sail was becalm'd between the seas,\r","though on the wave's high top too much to set,\r"," they dar'd not take it in for all the breeze:\r","each sea curl'd o'er the stern, and kept them wet,\r"," and made them bale without a moment's ease,\r","so that themsees as well as hopes were damp'd,\r","and the poor little cutter quickly swamp'i\r","nine souls more went in her: the long-boat still\r"," kept above water, with an oar for mast,\r","     \r","two blankets stitch'd together, answering ill\r"," instead of sail, were to the oar made fast;\r","though every wave roll'd menacing to fill,\r"," and present peril all before surpass'd,\r","they griev'd for those who perish'd with the cutter,\r","and also for the biscuit-casks and \r","the sun rose red and fiery, a sure sign\r"," of the continuance of the gale: to run\r","before the sea until it should grow fine\r"," was all that for the present could be done:\r","a few tea-spoonfuls of their rum and wine\r"," were serv'd out to the people, who begun\r","to faint, and damag'd bread wet through the bags,\r","and most of them had little clothes but i\r","they counted thirty, crowded in a space\r"," which left scarce room for motion or exertion;\r","they did their best to modify their case,\r"," one half sate up, though numb'd with the immersion,\r","while t'other half were laid down in their place,\r"," at watch and watch; thus, shivering like the tertian\r","ague in its cold fit, they fill'd their boat,\r","with nothing but the sky for a great \r","'tis very certain the desire of life\r","  prolongs it: this is obvious to physicians,\r","when patients, neither plagu'd with friends nor wife,\r","  survive through very desperate conditions,\r","because they still can hope, nor shines the knife\r","  nor shears of atropos before their visions:\r","despair of all recovery spoils longevity,\r","and makes men's misery of alarming\r","'tis said that persons living on annuities\r","  are longer liv'd than others--god knows why,\r","unless to plague the grantors--yet so true it is\r","  that some, i really think, do never die:\r","  \r","of any creditors the worst a jew it is,\r"," and that 's their mode of furnishing supply:\r","in my young days they lent me cash that way,\r","which i found very troublesome to i\r","'tis thus with people in an open boat,\r","  they live upon the love of life, and bear\r","more than can be believ'd, or even thought,\r","  and stand like rocks the tempest's wear and tear;\r","and hardship still has been the sailor's lot,\r","  since noah's ark went cruising here and there;\r","she had a curious crew as well as cargo,\r","like the first old greek privateer, the \r","but man is a carnivorous production,\r"," and must have meals, at least one meal a day;\r","he cannot live, like woodcocks, upon suction,\r"," but, like the shark and tiger, must have prey;\r","although his anatomical construction\r"," bears vegetables in a grumbling way,\r","your labouring people think, beyond all question,\r","beef, veal and mutton better for i\r","and thus it was with this our hapless crew;\r"," for on the third day there came on a calm,\r","and though at first their strength it might renew,\r"," and lying on their weariness like balm,\r","lull'd them like turtles sleeping on the blue\r"," of ocean, when they woke they felt a qualm,\r","and fell all ravenously on their provision,\r","instead of hoarding it with due i\r","the consequence was easily foreseen--\r"," they ate up all they had, and drank their wine,\r","in spite of all remonstrances, and then\r"," on what, in fact, next day were they to dine?\r","they hop'd the wind would rise, these foolish men!\r"," and carry them to shore; these hopes were fine,\r","but as they had but one oar, and that brittle,\r","it would have been more wise to save their\r","the fourth day came, but not a breath of air,\r"," and ocean slumber'd like an unwean'd child:\r","the fifth day, and their boat lay floating there,\r"," the sea and sky were blue, and clear, and mild--\r","with their one oar i wish they had had a pair\r"," what could they do? and hunger's rage grew wild:\r","so juan's spaniel, spite of his entreating,\r","was kill'd, and portion'd out for present i\r","on the sixth day they fed upon his hide,\r"," and juan, who had still refus'd, because\r","the creature was his father's dog that died,\r"," now feeling all the vulture in his jaws,\r","with some remorse receiv'd though first denied\r"," as a great favour one of the fore-paws,\r","which he divided with pedrillo, who\r","devour'd it, longing for the other \r","the seventh day, and no wind--the burning sun\r"," blister'd and scorch'd, and, stagnant on the sea,\r","they lay like carcasses; and hope was none,\r"," save in the breeze that came not; savagely\r","they glar'd upon each other--all was done,\r"," water, and wine, and food--and you might see\r","the longings of the cannibal arise\r","although they spoke not in their wolfish i\r","at length one whisper'd his companion, who\r"," whisper'd another, and thus it went round,\r","and then into a hoarser murmur grew,\r"," an ominous, and wild, and desperate sound;\r","and when his comrade's thought each sufferer knew,\r"," 'twas but his own, suppress'd till now, he found;\r","and out they spoke of lots for flesh and blood,\r","and who should die to be his fellow's \r","but ere they came to this, they that day shar'd\r"," some leathern caps, and what remain'd of shoes;\r","and then they look'd around them, and despair'd,\r"," and none to be the sacrifice would choose;\r","at length the lots were torn up, and prepar'd,\r"," but of materials that must shock the muse--\r","having no paper, for the want of better,\r","they took by force from juan julia's\r","the lots were made, and mark'd, and mix'd, and handed,\r"," in silent horror, and their distribution\r","lull'd even the savage hunger which demanded,\r"," like the promethean vulture, this pollution;\r","none in particular had sought or plann'd it,\r"," 'twas nature gnaw'd them to this resolution,\r","by which none were permitted to be neuter--\r","and the lot fell on juan's luckless i\r","he but requested to be bled to death:\r"," the surgeon had his instruments, and bled\r","pedrillo, and so gently ebb'd his breath,\r"," you hardly could perceive when he was dead\r","he died as born, a catholic in faith,\r"," like most in the belief in which they're bred,\r","and first a little crucifix he kiss'd,\r","and then held out his jugular and \r","the surgeon, as there was no other fee,\r"," had his first choice of morsels for his pains;\r","but being thirstiest at the moment, he\r"," preferr'd a draught from the fast-flowing vems:\r","part was divided, part thrown in the sea,\r"," and such things as the entrails and the brain;\r","regal'd two sharks, who follow'd o'er the billow--\r","the sailors ate the rest of poor i\r","  \r","the sailors ate him, all save three or four,\r"," who were not quite so fond of animal food\r","to these was added juan, who, before\r"," refusing his own spaniel, hardly could\r","feel now his appetite increas'd much more;\r"," 'twas not to be expected that he should,\r","even in extremity of their disaster,\r","dine with them on his pastor and his i\r","'twas better that he did not; for, in fact,\r"," the consequence was awful in the extreme;\r","for they, who were most ravenous in the act,\r"," went raging mad--lord! how they did blaspheme!\r","and foam and roll, with strange convulsions rack'd,\r"," drinking salt-water like a mountain-stream,\r","tearing, and grinning, howling, screeching, swearing,\r","and, with hyaena-laughter, died\r","their numbers were much thinn'd by this infliction,\r"," and all the rest were thin enough, heaven knows;\r","and some of them had lost their recollection,\r"," happier than they who still perceiv'd their woes;\r","but others ponder'd on a new dissection,\r"," as if not warn'd sufficiently by those\r","who had already perish'd, suflfering madly,\r","for having us'd their appetites so sadly \r","now overhead a rainbow, bursting through\r"," the scattering clouds, shone, spanning the dark sea,\r","resting its bright base on the quivering blue;\r"," and all within its arch appear'd to be\r","clearer than that without, and its wide hue\r"," wax'd broad and waving, like a banner free,\r","then chang'd like to a bow that's bent, and then\r","forsook the dim eyes of these shipwreck'd \r","it chang'd, of course; a heavenly chameleon,\r","  the airy child of vapour and the sun,\r","  \r","brought forth in purple, cradled in vermilion,\r"," baptiz'd in molten gold, and swath'd in dun,\r","glittering like crescents o'er a turk's pavilion,\r"," and blending every colour into one,\r","just like a black eye in a recent scuffle\r","for sometimes we must box without the muffle\r","our shipwreck'd seamen thought it a good omen--\r"," it is as well to think so, now and then;\r","'twas an old custom of the greek and roman,\r"," and may become of great advantage when\r","folks are discourag'd; and most surely no men\r"," had greater need to nerve themsees again\r","than these, and so this rainbow look'd like hope--\r","quite a celestial \r","about this time a beautiful white bird,\r","  webfooted, not unlike a dove in size\r","and plumage probably it might have err'd\r","  upon its course, pass'd oft before their eyes,\r","and tried to perch, although it saw and heard\r","  the men within the boat, and in this guise\r","it came and went, and flutter'd round them till\r","night fell--this seem'd a better omen\r","but in this case i also must remark,\r"," 'twas well this bird of promise did not perch,\r","because the tackle of our shatter'd bark\r"," was not so safe for roosting as a church;\r","and had it been the dove from noah's ark,\r"," returning there from her successful search,\r","which in their way that moment chanc'd to fall,\r","they would have eat her, olive-branch and i\r","with twilight it again came on to blow,\r"," but not with violence; the stars shone out,\r","the boat made way; yet now they were so low,\r"," they knew not where or what they were about;\r","some fancied they saw land, and some said \"no!\"\r"," the frequent fog-banks gave them cause to doubt--\r","some swore that they heard breakers, others guns,\r","and all mistook about the latter \r","as morning broke, the light wind died away,\r","  when he who had the watch sung out and swore,\r","if 'twas not land that rose with the sun's ray,\r","  he wish'd that land he never might see more;\r","and the rest rubb'd their eyes and saw a bay,\r","  or thought they saw, and shap'd their course for shore;\r","for shore it was, and gradually grew\r","distinct, and high, and palpable to i\r","and then of these some part burst into tears,\r"," and others, looking with a stupid stare,\r","could not yet separate their hopes from fears,\r"," and seem'd as if they had no further care;\r","while a few pray'd the first time for some years\r"," and at the bottom of the boat three were\r","asleep: they shook them by the hand and head,\r","and tried to awaken them, but found them i\r","the day before, fast sleeping on the water,\r"," they found a turtle of the hawk's-bill kind,\r","and by good fortune, gliding softly, caught her,\r"," which yielded a day's life, and to their mind\r","prov'd even still a more nutritious matter,\r"," because it left encouragement behind:\r","they thought that in such perils, more than chance\r","had sent them this for their deliverance\r","the land appear'd a high and rocky coast,\r"," and higher grew the mountains as they drew,\r","set by a current, toward it: they were lost\r"," in various conjectures, for none knew\r","to what part of the earth they had been toss'd,\r"," so changeable had been the winds that blew;\r","      \r","some thought it was mount atna, some the highlands\r","of candia, cyprus, rhodes, or other islandsci\r","meantime the current, with a rising gale,\r"," still set them onwards to the welcome shore,\r","like charon's bark of spectres, dull and pale:\r"," their living freight was now reduc'd to four,\r","and three dead, whom their strength could not avail\r"," to heave into the deep with those before,\r","though the two sharks still follow'd them, and dash'd\r","the spray into their faces as they splash'd\r","famine, despair, cold, thirst and heat had done\r"," their work on them by turns, and thinn'd them to\r","such things a mother had not known her son\r"," amidst the skeletons of that gaunt crew;\r","by night chill'd, by day scorch'd, thus one by one\r"," they perish'd, until wither'd to these few,\r","but chiefly by a species of self-slaughter,\r","in washing down pedrillo with salt waterci\r","as they drew nigh the land, which now was seen\r"," unequal in its aspect here and there,\r","they felt the freshness of its growing green,\r"," that wav'd in forest-tops, and smooth'd the air,\r","and fell upon their glaz'd eyes like a screen\r"," from glistening waves, and skies so hot and bare--\r","lovely seem'd any object that should sweep\r","away the vast, salt, dread, eternal deep\r","the shore look'd wild, without a trace of man,\r"," and girt by formidable waves; but they\r","were mad for land, and thus their course they ran,\r"," though right ahead the roaring breakers lay:\r","a reef between them also now began\r"," to show its boiling surf and bounding spray,\r","but finding no place for their landing better,\r","they ran the boat for shore, and overset\r"," \r","but in his native stream, the guadalquivir,\r"," juan to lave his youthful limbs was wont;\r","and having learnt to swim in that sweet river,\r"," had often turn'd the art to some account:\r","a better swimmer you could scarce see ever,\r"," he could, perhaps, have pass'd the hellespont,\r","as once a feat on which oursees we prided\r","leander, mr ekenhead, and i i\r","so here, though faint, emaciated and stark,\r"," he buoy'd his boyish limbs, and strove to ply\r","with the quick wave, and gain, ere it was dark,\r"," the beach which lay before him, high and dry:\r","the greatest danger here was from a shark,\r"," that carried off his neighbour by the thigh;\r","as for the other two, they could not swim,\r","so nobody arriv'd on shore but \r","nor yet had he arriv'd but for the oar,\r"," which, providentially for him, was wash'd\r","just as his feeble arms could strike no more,\r"," and the hard wave o'erwhelm'd him as 'twas dash'd\r","within his grasp; he clung to it, and sore\r"," the waters beat while he thereto was lash'd;\r","at last, with swimming, wading, scrambling, he\r","roll'd on the beach, half-senseless, from the sea:cvi\r","there, breathless, with his digging nails he clung\r"," fast to the sand, lest the returning wave,\r","from whose reluctant roar his life he wrung,\r"," should suck him back to her insatiate grave:\r","and there he lay, full length, where he was flung,\r"," before the entrance of a cliff-worn cave,\r","with just enough of life to feel its pain,\r","and deem that it was sav'd, perhaps in vaincl\r","   \r","and thus a moon roll'd on, and fair haidee\r"," paid daily visits to her boy, and took\r","such plentiful precautions, that still he\r"," remain'd unknown within his craggy nook;\r","at last her father's prows put out to sea,\r"," for certain merchantmen upon the look,\r","not as of yore to carry off an io,\r","but three ragusan vessels, bound for\r","then came her freedom, for she had no mother,\r","  so that, her father being at sea, she was\r","free as a married woman, or such other\r","  female, as where she likes may freely pass,\r","without even the encumbrance of a brother,\r","  the freest she that ever gaz'd on glass:\r","i speak of christian lands in this comparison,\r","where wives, at least, are seldom kept in i\r","now she prolong'd her visits and her talk\r"," for they must talk, and he had learnt to say\r","so much as to propose to take a walk--\r"," for little had he wander'd since the day\r","on which, like a young flower snapp'd from the stalk,\r"," drooping and dewy on the beach he lay--\r","and thus they walk'd out in the afternoon,\r","and saw the sun set opposite the \r","it was a wild and breaker-beaten coast,\r","  with cliffs above, and a broad sandy shore,\r","guarded by shoals and rocks as by an host,\r","  with here and there a creek, whose aspect wore\r","a better welcome to the tempest-tost;\r","  and rarely ceas'd the haughty billow's roar,\r","save on the dead long summer days, which make\r","the outstretch'd ocean glitter like a i\r"," \r","and the small ripple spilt upon the beach\r"," scarcely o'erpass'd the cream of your champagne,\r","when o'er the brim the sparkling bumpers reach,\r"," that spring-dew of the spirit! the heart's rain!\r","few things surpass old wine; and they may preach\r"," who please--the more because they preach in vain,\r","let us have wine and women, mirth and laughter,\r","sermons and soda-water the day i\r","man, being reasonable, must get drunk;\r"," the best of life is but intoxication:\r","glory, the grape, love, gold, in these are sunk\r"," the hopes of all men, and of every nation;\r","without their sap, how branchless were the trunk\r"," of life's strange tree, so fruitful on occasion:\r","but to return--get very drunk, and when\r","you wake with headache, you shall see what\r","ring for your valet--bid him quickly bring\r"," some hock and soda-water, then you'll know\r","a pleasure worthy xerxes the great king;\r"," for not the blest sherbet, sublim'd with snow,\r","nor the first sparkle of the desert-spring,\r"," nor burgundy in all its sunset glow,\r","after long travel, ennui, love, or slaughter,\r","vie with that draught of hock and soda-water!\r","the coast--i think it was the coast that i\r"," was just describing--yes, it was the coast--\r","lay at this period quiet as the sky,\r"," the sands untumbled, the blue waves untoss'd,\r","and all was stillness, save the sea-bird's cry,\r"," and dolphin's leap, and the little billow cross'd\r","by some low rock or shee, that made it fret\r","against the boundary it scarcely \r","and forth they wander'd, her sire being gone,\r"," as i have said, upon an expedition;\r","and mother, brother, guardian, she had none,\r"," save zoe, who, although with due precision\r","she waited on her lady with the sun,\r"," thought daily service was her only mission,\r","bringing warm water, wreathing her long tresses,\r","and asking now and then for cast-off i\r","it was the cooling hour, just when the rounded\r","  red sun sinks down behind the azure hill,\r","which then seems as if the whole earth it bounded,\r","  circling all nature, hush'd, and dim, and still,\r","with the far mountain-crescent half surrounded\r","  on one side, and the deep sea calm and chill\r","upon the other, and the rosy sky\r","with one star sparkling through it like an \r","and thus they wander'd forth, and hand in hand,\r"," over the shining pebbles and the shells,\r","glided along the smooth and harden'd sand,\r"," and in the worn and wild receptacles\r","work'd by the storms, yet work'd as it were plann'd\r"," in hollow halls, with sparry roofs and cells,\r","they turn'd to rest; and, each clasp'd by an arm,\r","yielded to the deep twilight's purple v\r","they look'd up to the sky, whose floating glow\r"," spread like a rosy ocean, vast and bright;\r","they gaz'd upon the glittering sea below,\r"," whence the broad moon rose circling into sight;\r","they heard the wave's splash, and the wind so low,\r"," and saw each other's dark eyes darting light\r","into each other--and, beholding this,\r","their lips drew near, and clung into a kiss;\r","a long, long kiss, a kiss of youth, and love,\r","  and beauty, all concentrating like rays\r","into one focus, kindled from above;\r","  such kisses as belong to early days,\r","where heart, and soul, and sense, in concert move,\r","  and the blood's lava, and the pulse a blaze,\r","each kiss a heart-quake--for a kiss's strength,\r","i think, it must be reckon'd by its v\r","by length i mean duration; theirs endur'd\r"," heaven knows how long--no doubt they never reckon'd;\r","and if they had, they could not have secur'd\r"," the sum of their sensations to a second:\r","they had not spoken, but they felt allur'd,\r"," as if their souls and lips each other beckon'd,\r","which, being join'd, like swarming bees they clung--\r","their hearts the flowers from whence the honey vi\r","they were alone, but not alone as they\r"," who shut in chambers think it loneliness;\r","the silent ocean, and the starlight bay,\r"," the twilight glow, which momently grew less,\r","the voiceless sands, and dropping caves, that lay\r"," around them, made them to each other press,\r","as if there were no life beneath the sky\r","save theirs, and that their life could never i\r","they fear'd no eyes nor ears on that lone beach;\r"," they felt no terrors from the night; they were\r","  \r","all in all to each other: though their speech\r"," was broken words, they thought a language there,\r","and all the burning tongues the passions teach\r"," found in one sigh the best interpreter\r","of nature's oracle--first love--that all\r","which eve has left her daughters since her\r","haidee spoke not of scruples, ask'd no vows,\r"," nor offer'd any; she had never heard\r","of plight and promises to be a spouse,\r"," or perils by a loving maid incurr'd;\r","she was all which pure ignorance allows,\r"," and flew to her young mate like a young bird;\r","and, never having dreamt of falsehood, she\r","had not one word to say of i\r","she lov'd, and was beloved--she ador'd,\r"," and she was worshipp'd; after nature's fashion,\r","their intense souls, into each other pour'd,\r"," if souls could die, had perish'd in that passion,\r","but by degrees their senses were restor'd,\r"," again to be o'ercome, again to dash on;\r","and, beating 'gainst his bosom, haidee's heart\r","felt as if never more to beat \r","alas! they were so young, so beautiful,\r"," so lonely, loving, helpless, and the hour\r","was that in which the heart is always full,\r"," and, having o'er itself no further power,\r","prompts deeds eternity can not annul,\r"," but pays off moments in an endless shower\r","of hell-fire--all prepar'd for people

should \r","they look upon each other, and their eyes\r"," gleam in the moonlight; and her white arm clasps\r","round juan's head, and his around her lies\r"," half buried in the tresses which it grasps;\r","she sits upon his knee, and drinks his sighs,\r"," he hers, until they end in broken gasps;\r","and thus they form a group that's quite antique,\r","half naked, loving, natural, and\r","and when those deep and burning moments pass'd,\r","  and juan sunk to sleep within her arms,\r","she slept not, but all tenderly, though fast,\r","  sustain'd his head upon her bosom's

way;\r","'twas nine, when still advancing undismay'd,\r","within a cable's length their vessels lay\r","off ismail, and commenced a cannonade,\r","which was return'd with interest, i may say,\r","and by a fire of musketry and grape,\r","and shells and shot of every size and shape\r","for six hours bore they without intermission\r","the turkish fire, and aided by their own\r","land batteries,

wasted,\r","as e'er was locust on the land it blasted\r","this was potemkin--a great thing in days\r","when homicide and harlotry made great;\r","if stars and titles could entail long praise,\r","his glory might half equal his estate\r","this fellow, being six foot high, could raise\r","a kind of phantasy proportionate\r","in the then sovereign of the russian people,\r","who measured men as you would do a steeple\r","     \r","while things were in abeyance, ribas sent\r","a courier to the prince, and he succeeded\r","in ordering matters after his own bent;\r","i cannot tell the way in which he pleaded,\r","but shortly he had cause to be content\r","in the mean time, the batteries proceeded,\r","and fourscore cannon on the danube's border\r","were briskly fired and answer'd in due order\r","but on the thirteenth, when already part\r","of the troops were embark'd, the siege to raise,\r","a courier on the spur inspired new heart\r","into all panters for newspaper praise,\r","as well as dilettanti in war's art,\r","by his despatches couch'd in pithy phrase;\r","announcing the appointment of that lover of\r","battles to the command, field-marshal souvaroff\r","the letter of the prince to the same marshal\r","was worthy of a spartan, had the cause\r","been one to which a good heart could be partial--\r","defence of freedom, country, or of laws;\r","but as it was mere lust of power to o'er-arch all\r","with its proud brow, it merits slight applause,\r","save for its style, which said, all in a trice,\r","'you will take ismail at whatever price'\r","'let there be light! said god, and there was light!'\r","'let there be blood!' says man, and there's a seal\r","the fiat of this spoil'd child of the night\r","for day ne'er saw his merits could decree\r","more evil in an hour, than thirty bright\r","summers could renovate, though they should be\r","lovely as those which ripen'd eden's fruit;\r","for war cuts up not only branch, but root\r","our friends the turks, who with loud 'allahs' now\r","began to signalise the russ retreat,\r","were damnably mistaken; few are slow\r","in thinking that their enemy is beat\r","or beaten, if you insist on grammar, though\r","i never think about it in a heat,\r","but here i say the turks were much mistaken,\r","who hating hogs, yet wish'd to save their bacon\r","for, on the sixteenth, at full gallop, drew\r","in sight two horsemen, who were deem'd cossacques\r","for some time, till they came in nearer view\r","they had but little baggage at their backs,\r","for there were but three shirts between the two;\r","but on they rode upon two ukraine hacks,\r","till, in approaching, were at length descried\r","in this plain pair, suwarrow and his guide\r","'great joy to london now!' says some great fool,\r","when london had a grand illumination,\r","which to that bottle-conjurer, john bull,\r","is of all dreams the first hallucination;\r","so that the streets of colour'd lamps are full,\r","that sage said john surrenders at discretion\r","his purse, his soul, his sense, and even his nonsense,\r","to gratify, like a huge moth, this one sense\r","'t is strange that he should farther 'damn his eyes,'\r","for they are damn'd; that once all-famous oath\r","is to the devil now no farther prize,\r","since john has lately lost the use of both\r","debt he calls wealth, and taxes paradise;\r","and famine, with her gaunt and bony growth,\r","which stare him in the face, he won't examine,\r","or swears that ceres hath begotten famine\r","but to the tale:--great joy unto the camp!\r","to russian, tartar, english, french, cossacque,\r","o'er whom suwarrow shone like a gas lamp,\r","presaging a most luminous attack;\r","or like a wisp along the marsh so damp,\r","which leads beholders on a boggy walk,\r","he flitted to and fro a dancing light,\r","which all who saw it follow'd, wrong or right\r","but certes matters took a different face;\r","there was enthusiasm and much applause,\r","the fleet and camp saluted with great grace,\r","  \r","and all presaged good fortune to their cause\r","within a cannon-shot length of the place\r","they drew, constructed ladders, repair'd flaws\r","in former works, made new, prepared fascines,\r","and all kinds of benevolent machines\r","'tis thus the spirit of a single mind\r","makes that of multitudes take one direction,\r","as roll the waters to the breathing wind,\r","or roams the herd beneath the bull's protection;\r","or as a little dog will lead the blind,\r","or a bell-wether form the flock's connection\r","by tinkling sounds, when they go forth to victual;\r","such is the sway of your great men o'er little\r","the whole camp rung with joy; you would have thought\r","that they were going to a marriage feast\r","this metaphor, i think, holds good as aught,\r","since there is discord after both at least:\r","there was not now a luggage boy but sought\r","danger and spoil with ardour much increased;\r","and why? because a little--odd--old man,\r","stript to his shirt, was come to lead the van\r","but so it was; and every preparation\r","was made with all alacrity: the first\r","detachment of three columns took its station,\r","and waited but the signal's voice to burst\r","upon the foe: the second's ordination\r","was also in three columns, with a thirst\r","for glory gaping o'er a sea of slaughter:\r","the third, in columns two, attack'd by water\r","new batteries were erected, and was held\r","a general council, in which unanimity,\r","that stranger to most councils, here prevail'd,\r","as sometimes happens in a great extremity;\r","and every difficulty being dispell'd,\r","glory began to dawn with due sublimity,\r","while souvaroff, determined to obtain it,\r","was teaching his recruits to use the bayonet\r","it is an actual fact, that he, commander\r","in chief, in proper person deign'd to drill\r","the awkward squad, and could afford to squander\r","his time, a corporal's duty to fulfil:\r","just as you 'd break a sucking salamander\r","to swallow flame, and never take it ill:\r","he show'd them how to mount a ladder which\r","was not like jacob's or to cross a ditch\r","also he dress'd up, for the nonce, fascines\r","like men with turbans, scimitars, and dirks,\r","and made them charge with bayonet these machines,\r","by way of lesson against actual turks:\r","and when well practised in these mimic scenes,\r","he judged them proper to assail the works;\r","at which your wise men sneer'd in phrases witty:\r","he made no answer; but he took the city\r","most things were in this posture on the eve\r","of the assault, and all the camp was in\r","a stern repose; which you would scarce conceive;\r","yet men resoed to dash through thick and thin\r","are very silent when they once believe\r","that all is settled:--there was little din,\r","for some were thinking of their home and friends,\r","and others of themsees and latter ends\r","suwarrow chiefly was on the alert,\r","surveying, drilling, ordering, jesting, pondering;\r","for the man was, we safely may assert,\r","a thing to wonder at beyond most wondering;\r","hero, buffoon, half-demon, and half-dirt,\r","praying, instructing, desolating, plundering;\r","now mars, now momus; and when bent to storm\r","a fortress, harlequin in uniform\r","the day before the assault, while upon drill--\r","for this great conqueror play'd the corporal--\r","some cossacques, hovering like hawks round a hill,\r","had met a party towards the twilight's fall,\r","one of whom spoke their tongue--or well or ill,\r","'twas much that he was understood at all;\r","     \r","but whether from his voice, or speech, or manner,\r","they found that he had fought beneath their banner\r","whereon immediately at his request\r","they brought him and his comrades to head-quarters;\r","their dress was moslem, but you might have guess'd\r","that these were merely masquerading tartars,\r","and that beneath each turkish-fashion'd vest\r","lurk'd christianity; which sometimes barters\r","her inward grace for outward show, and makes\r","it difficult to shun some strange mistakes\r","suwarrow, who was standing in his shirt\r","before a company of calmucks, drilling,\r","exclaiming, fooling, swearing at the inert,\r","and lecturing on the noble art of killing,--\r","for deeming human clay but common dirt,\r","this great philosopher was thus instilling\r","his maxims, which to martial comprehension\r","proved death in battle equal to a pension;--\r","suwarrow, when he saw this company\r","of cossacques and their prey, turn'd round and cast\r","upon them his slow brow and piercing eye:-\r","'whence come ye?'--'from constantinople last,\r","captives just now escaped,' was the reply\r","'what are ye?'--'what you see us' briefly pass'd\r","this dialogue; for he who answer'd knew\r","to whom he spoke, and made his words but few\r","'your names?'--'mine's johnson, and my comrade's juan;\r","the other two are women, and the third\r","is neither man nor woman' the chief threw on\r","the party a slight glance, then said, 'i have heard\r","your name before, the second is a new one:\r","to bring the other three here was absurd:\r","but let that pass:--i think i have heard your name\r","in the nikolaiew regiment?'--'the same'\r","'you served at widdin?'--'yes'--'you led the attack?'\r","'i did'--'what next?'--'i really hardly know'\r","'you were the first i'the breach?'--'i was not slack\r","  \r","at least to follow those who might be so'\r","'what follow'd?'--'a shot laid me on my back,\r","and i became a prisoner to the foe'\r","'you shall have vengeance, for the town surrounded\r","is twice as strong as that where you were wounded\r","'where will you serve?'--'where'er you please'--'i know\r","you like to be the hope of the forlorn,\r","and doubtless would be foremost on the foe\r","after the hardships you've already borne\r","and this young fellow--say what can he do?\r","he with the beardless chin and garments torn?'\r","'why, general, if he hath no greater fault\r","in war than love, he had better lead the assault'\r","'he shall if that he dare' here juan bow'd\r","low as the compliment deserved suwarrow\r","continued: 'your old regiment's allow'd,\r","by special providence, to lead to-morrow,\r","or it may be to-night, the assault: i have vow'd\r","to several saints, that shortly plough or harrow\r","shall pass o'er what was ismail, and its tusk\r","be unimpeded by the proudest mosque\r","'so now, my lads, for glory!'--here he turn'd\r","and drill'd away in the most classic russian,\r","until each high, heroic bosom burn'd\r","for cash and conquest, as if from a cushion\r","a preacher had held forth who nobly spurn'd\r","all earthly goods save tithes and bade them push on\r","to slay the pagans who resisted, battering\r","the armies of the christian empress catherine\r","johnson, who knew by this long colloquy\r","himself a favourite, ventured to address\r","suwarrow, though engaged with accents high\r","in his resumed amusement 'i confess\r","my debt in being thus allow'd to die\r","among the foremost; but if you'd express\r","explicitly our several posts, my friend\r","and self would know what duty to attend'\r","    \r","'right! i was busy, and forgot why, you\r","will join your former regiment, which should be\r","now under arms ho! katskoff, take him to\r","here he call'd up a polish orderly\r","his post, i mean the regiment nikolaiew:\r","the stranger stripling may remain with me;\r","he's a fine boy the women may be sent\r","to the other baggage, or to the sick tent'\r","but here a sort of scene began to ensue:\r","the ladies,--who by no means had been bred\r","to be disposed of in a way so new,\r","although their haram education led\r","doubtless to that of doctrines the most true,\r","passive obedience,--now raised up the head,\r","with flashing eyes and starting tears, and flung\r","their arms, as hens their wings about their young,\r","o'er the promoted couple of brave men\r","who were thus honour'd by the greatest chief\r","that ever peopled hell with heroes slain,\r","or plunged a province or a realm in grief\r","oh, foolish mortals! always taught in vain!\r","oh, glorious laurel! since for one sole leaf\r","of thine imaginary deathless tree,\r","of blood and tears must flow the unebbing sea\r","suwarrow, who had small regard for tears,\r","and not much sympathy for blood, survey'd\r","the women with their hair about their ears\r","and natural agonies, with a slight shade\r","of feeling: for however habit sears\r","men's hearts against whole millions, when their trade\r","is butchery, sometimes a single sorrow\r","will touch even heroes- and such was suwarrow\r","he said,--and in the kindest calmuck tone,--\r","'why, johnson, what the devil do you mean\r","by bringing women here? they shall be shown\r","all the attention possible, and seen\r","in safety to the waggons, where alone\r","in fact they can be safe you should have been\r"," \r","aware this kind of baggage never thrives:\r","save wed a year, i hate recruits with wives'\r","'may it please your excellency,' thus replied\r","our british friend, 'these are the wives of others,\r","and not our own i am too qualified\r","by service with my military brothers\r","to break the rules by bringing one's own bride\r","into a camp: i know that nought so bothers\r","the hearts of the heroic on a charge,\r","as leaving a small family at large\r","'but these are but two turkish ladies, who\r","with their attendant aided our escape,\r","and afterwards accompanied us through\r","a thousand perils in this dubious shape\r","to me this kind of life is not so new;\r","to them, poor things, it is an awkward scrape\r","i therefore, if you wish me to fight freely,\r","request that they may both be used genteelly'\r","meantime these two poor girls, with swimming eyes,\r","look'd on as if in doubt if they could trust\r","their own protectors; nor was their surprise\r","less than their grief and truly not less just\r","to see an old man, rather wild than wise\r","in aspect, plainly clad, besmear'd with dust,\r","stript to his waistcoat, and that not too clean,\r","more fear'd than all the sultans ever seen\r","for every thing seem'd resting on his nod,\r","as they could read in all eyes now to them,\r","who were accustom'd, as a sort of god,\r","to see the sultan, rich in many a gem,\r","like an imperial peacock stalk abroad\r","that royal bird, whose tail's a diadem,\r","with all the pomp of power, it was a doubt\r","how power could condescend to do without\r","john johnson, seeing their extreme dismay,\r","though little versed in feelings oriental,\r","suggested some slight comfort in his way:\r","don juan, who was much more sentimental,\r","swore they should see him by the dawn of day,\r","or that the russian army should repent all:\r","and, strange to say, they found some consolation\r","in this--for females like exaggeration\r","and then with tears, and sighs, and some slight kisses,\r","they parted for the present--these to await,\r","according to the artillery's hits or misses,\r","what sages call chance, providence, or fate\r","uncertainty is one of many blisses,\r","a mortgage on humanity's estate--\r","while their beloved friends began to arm,\r","to burn a town which never did them harm\r","suwarrow,--who but saw things in the gross,\r","being much too gross to see them in detail,\r","who calculated life as so much dross,\r","and as the wind a widow'd nation's wail,\r","and cared as little for his army's loss\r","so that their efforts should at length prevail\r","as wife and friends did for the boils of job,--\r","what was't to him to hear two women sob?\r","nothing--the work of glory still went on\r","in preparations for a cannonade\r","as terrible as that of ilion,\r","if homer had found mortars ready made;\r","but now, instead of slaying priam's son,\r","we only can but talk of escalade,\r","bombs, drums, guns, bastions, batteries, bayonets, bullets,--\r","hard words, which stick in the soft muses' gullets\r","oh, thou eternal homer! who couldst charm\r","all cars, though long; all ages, though so short,\r","by merely wielding with poetic arm\r","arms to which men will never more resort,\r","unless gunpowder should be found to harm\r","much less than is the hope of every court,\r","which now is leagued young freedom to annoy;\r","but they will not find liberty a troy:--\r","         \r","oh, thou eternal homer! i have now\r","to paint a siege, wherein more men were slain,\r","with deadlier engines and a speedier blow,\r","than in thy greek gazette of that campaign;\r","and yet, like all men else, i must allow,\r","to vie with thee would be about as vain\r","as for a brook to cope with ocean's flood;\r","but still we moderns equal you in blood;\r","if not in poetry, at least in fact;\r","and fact is truth, the grand desideratum!\r","of which, howe'er the muse describes each act,\r","there should be ne'ertheless a slight substratum\r","but now the town is going to be attack'd;\r","great deeds are doing- how shall i relate 'em?\r","souls of immortal generals! phoebus watches\r","to colour up his rays from your despatches\r","oh, ye great bulletins of bonaparte!\r","oh, ye less grand long lists of kill'd and wounded!\r","shade of leonidas, who fought so hearty,\r","when my poor greece was once, as now, surrounded!\r","oh, caesar's commentaries! now impart, ye\r","shadows of glory! lest i be confounded\r","a portion of your fading twilight hues,\r","so beautiful, so fleeting, to the muse\r","when i call 'fading' martial immortality,\r","i mean, that every age and every year,\r","and almost every day, in sad reality,\r","some sucking hero is compell'd to rear,\r","who, when we come to sum up the totality\r","of deeds to human happiness most dear,\r","turns out to be a butcher in great business,\r","afflicting young folks with a sort of dizziness\r","medals, rank, ribands, lace, embroidery, scarlet,\r","are things immortal to immortal man,\r","as purple to the babylonian harlot:\r","an uniform to boys is like a fan\r","to women; there is scarce a crimson varlet\r","but deems himself the first in glory's van\r","but glory's glory; and if you would find\r","what that is--ask the pig who sees the wind!\r","at least he feels it, and some say he sees,\r","because he runs before it like a pig;\r","or, if that simple sentence should displease,\r","say, that he scuds before it like a brig,\r","a schooner, or--but it is time to ease\r","this canto, ere my muse perceives fatigue\r","the

be disdain'd,\r","i wish they 'd state how many they have gain'd\r","and juan, on retiring for the night,\r","felt restless, and perplex'd, and compromised:\r","he thought aurora raby's eyes more bright\r","than adeline such is advice advised;\r","if he had known exactly his own plight,\r","he probably would have philosophised:\r","a great resource to all, and ne'er denied\r","till wanted; therefore juan only sigh'd\r","he sigh'd;--the next resource is the full moon,\r","where all sighs are deposited; and now\r","it happen'd luckily, the chaste orb shone\r","as clear as such a climate will allow;\r","and juan's mind was in the proper tone\r","to hail her with the apostrophe--'o thou!'\r","of amatory egotism the tuism,\r","which further to explain would be a truism\r","but lover, poet, or astronomer,\r","shepherd, or swain, whoever may behold,\r","feel some abstraction when they gaze on her:\r","great thoughts we catch from thence besides a cold\r","sometimes, unless my feelings rather err;\r","deep secrets to her rolling light are told;\r","the ocean's tides and mortals' brains she sways,\r","and also hearts, if there be truth in lays\r","juan felt somewhat pensive, and disposed\r","for contemplation rather than his pillow:\r","the gothic chamber, where he was enclosed,\r","let in the rippling sound of the lake's billow,\r","with all the mystery by midnight caused;\r","below his window waved of course a willow;\r","and he stood gazing out on the cascade\r","that flash'd and after darken'd in the shade\r","upon his table or his toilet,--which\r","of these is not exactly ascertain'd\r","i state this, for i am cautious to a pitch\r","of nicety, where a fact is to be gain'd,--\r","a lamp burn'd high, while he leant from a niche,\r","where many a gothic ornament remain'd,\r","in chisell'd stone and painted glass, and all\r","that time has left our fathers of their hall\r","then, as the night was clear though cold, he threw\r","his chamber door wide openand went forth\r","into a gallery, of a sombre hue,\r","long, furnish'd with old pictures of great worth,\r","of knights and dames heroic and chaste too,\r","as doubtless should be people of high birth\r","but by dim lights the portraits of the dead\r","have something ghastly, desolate, and dread\r","the forms of the grim knight and pictured saint\r","look living in the moon; and as you turn\r","backward and forward to the echoes faint\r","of your own footstepsvoices from the urn\r","appear to wake, and shadows wild and quaint\r","start from the frames which fence their aspects stern,\r","as if to ask how you can dare to keep\r","a vigil there, where all but death should sleep\r","and the pale smile of beauties in the grave,\r","the charms of other days, in starlight gleams,\r","glimmer on high; their buried locks still wave\r","  \r","along the canvas; their eyes glance like dreams\r","on ours, or spars within some dusky cave,\r","but death is imaged in their shadowy beams\r","a picture is the past; even ere its frame\r","be gilt, who sate hath ceased to be the same\r","as juan mused on mutability,\r","or on his mistressterms synonymous -\r","no sound except the echo of his sigh\r","or step ran sadly through that antique house;\r","when suddenly he heard, or thought so, nigh,\r","a supernatural agentor a mouse,\r","whose little nibbling rustle will embarrass\r","most people as it plays along the arras\r","it was no mouse, but lo! a monk, array'd\r","in cowl and beads and dusky garb, appear'd,\r","now in the moonlight, and now lapsed in shade,\r","with steps that trod as heavy, yet unheard;\r","his garments only a slight murmur made;\r","he moved as shadowy as the sisters weird,\r","but slowly; and as he pass'd juan by,\r","glanced, without pausing, on him a bright eye\r","juan was petrified; he had heard a hint\r","of such a spirit in these halls of old,\r","but thought, like most men, there was nothing in't\r","beyond the rumour which such spots unfold,\r","coin'd from surviving superstition's mint,\r","which passes ghosts in currency like gold,\r","but rarely seen, like gold compared with paper\r","and did he see this? or was it a vapour?\r","once, twice, thrice pass'd, repass'd--the thing of air,\r","or earth beneath, or heaven, or t'other place;\r","and juan gazed upon it with a stare,\r","yet could not speak or move; but, on its base\r","as stands a statue, stood: he felt his hair\r","twine like a knot of snakes around his face;\r","he tax'd his tongue for words, which were not granted,\r","to ask the reverend person what he wanted\r","   \r","the third time, after a still longer pause,\r","the shadow pass'd away--but where? the hall\r","was long, and thus far there was no great cause\r","to think his vanishing unnatural:\r","doors there were many, through which, by the laws\r","of physics, bodies whether short or tall\r","might come or go; but juan could not state\r","through which the spectre seem'd to evaporate\r","he stood -- how long he knew not, but it seem'd\r","an age -- expectant, powerless, with his eyes\r","strain'd on the spot where first the figure gleam'd;\r","then by degrees recall'd his energies,\r","and would have pass'd the whole off as a dream,\r","but could not wake; he was, he did surmise,\r","waking already, and return'd at length\r","back to his chamber, shorn of half his strength\r","all there was as he left it: still his taper\r","burnt, and not blue, as modest tapers use,\r","receiving sprites with sympathetic vapour;\r","he rubb'd his eyes, and they did not refuse\r","their office; he took up an old newspaper;\r","the paper was right easy to peruse;\r","he read an article the king attacking,\r","and a long eulogy of 'patent blacking'\r","this savour'd of this world; but his hand shook--\r","he shut his door, and after having read\r","a paragraph, i think about horne tooke,\r","undrest, and rather slowly went to bed\r","there, couch'd all snugly on his pillow's nook,\r","with what he had seen his phantasy he fed;\r","and though it was no opiate, slumber crept\r","upon him by degrees, and so he slept\r","he woke betimes; and, as may be supposed,\r","ponder'd upon his visitant or vision,\r","and whether it ought not to be disclosed,\r","at risk of being quizz'd for superstition\r","the more he thought, the more his mind was posed:\r","in the mean time, his valet, whose precision\r","was great, because his master brook'd no less,\r","knock'd to inform him it was time to dress\r","he dress'd; and like young people he was wont\r","to take some trouble with his toilet, but\r","this morning rather spent less time upon't;\r","aside his very mirror soon was put;\r","his curls fell negligently o'er his front,\r","his clothes were not curb'd to their usual cut,\r","his very neckcloth's gordian knot was tied\r","almost an hair's breadth too much on one side\r","and when he walk'd down into the saloon,\r","he sate him pensive o'er a dish of tea,\r","which he perhaps had not discover'd soon,\r","had it not happen'd scalding hot to be,\r","which made him have recourse unto his spoon;\r","so much distrait he was, that all could see\r","that something was the matter -- adeline\r","the first -- but what she could not well divine\r","she look'd, and saw him pale, and turn'd as pale\r","herself; then hastily look'd down, and mutter'd\r","something, but what's not stated in my tale\r","lord henry said his muffin was ill butter'd;\r","the duchess of fitz-fulke play'd with her veil,\r","and look'd at juan hard, but nothing utter'd\r","aurora raby with her large dark eyes\r","survey'd him with a kind of calm surprise\r","but seeing him all cold and silent still,\r","and everybody wondering more or less,\r","fair adeline enquired, 'if he were ill?'\r","he started, and said, 'yes--no--rather--yes'\r","the family physician had great skill,\r","and being present, now began to express\r","his readiness to feel his pulse and tell\r","the cause, but juan said, 'he was quite well'\r","'quite well; yes,--no'--these answers were mysterious,\r","and yet his looks appear'd to sanction both,\r","however they might savour of delirious;\r","   \r","something like illness of a sudden growth\r","weigh'd on his spirit, though by no means serious:\r","but for the rest, as he himself seem'd loth\r","to state the case, it might be ta'en for granted\r","it was not the physician that he wanted\r","lord henry, who had now discuss'd his chocolate,\r","also the muffin whereof he complain'd,\r","said, juan had not got his usual look elate,\r","at which he marvell'd, since it had not rain'd;\r","then ask'd her grace what news were of the duke of late?\r","her grace replied, his grace was rather pain'd\r","with some slight, light, hereditary twinges\r","of gout, which rusts aristocratic hinges\r","then henry turn'd to juan, and address'd\r","a few words of condolence on his state:\r","'you look,' quoth he, 'as if you had had your rest\r","broke in upon by the black friar of late'\r","'what friar?' said juan; and he did his best\r","to put the question with an air sedate,\r","or careless; but the effort was not valid\r","to hinder him from growing still more pallid\r","'oh! have you never heard of the black friar?\r","the spirit of these walls?'--'in truth not i'\r","'why fame--but fame you know 's sometimes a liar--\r","tells an odd story, of which by and by:\r","whether with time the spectre has grown shyer,\r","or that our sires had a more gifted eye\r","for such sights, though the tale is half believed,\r","the friar of late has not been oft perceived\r","who watch'd the changes of don juan's brow,\r","and from its context thought she could divine\r","connexions stronger then he chose to avow\r","with this same legend--'if you but design\r","to jest, you'll choose some other theme just now,\r","because the present tale has oft been told,\r","and is not much improved by growing old'\r","'jest!' quoth milor; 'why, adeline, you know\r","    \r","that we oursees'twas in the honey-moon--\r","but, come, i'll set your story to a tune'\r","graceful as dian, when she draws her bow,\r","she seized her harp, whose strings were kindled soon\r","as touch'd, and plaintively began to play\r","the air of ''twas a friar of orders gray'\r","'but add the words,' cried henry, 'which you made;\r","for adeline is half a poetess,'\r","turning round to the rest, he smiling said\r","of course the others could not but express\r","in courtesy their wish to see display'd\r","by one three talents, for there were no less--\r","the voice, the words, the harper's skill, at once\r","could hardly be united by a dunce\r","after some fascinating hesitation,--\r","the charming of these charmers, who seem bound,\r","i can't tell why, to this dissimulation,--\r","fair adeline, with eyes fix'd on the ground\r","at first, then kindling into animation,\r","added her sweet voice to the lyric sound,\r","and sang with much simplicity,--a merit\r","not the less precious, that we seldom hear it\r","beware! beware! of the black friar,\r","who sitteth by norman stone,\r","for he mutters his prayer in the midnight air,\r","and his mass of the days that are gone\r","when the lord of the hill, amundeville,\r","made norman church his prey,\r","and expell'd the friars, one friar still\r","would not be driven away\r","though he came in his might, with king henry's right,\r","to turn church lands to lay,\r","with sword in hand, and torch to light\r","their walls, if they said nay;\r","a monk remain'd, unchased, unchain'd,\r","and he did not seem form'd of clay,\r","for he's seen in the porch, and he 's seen in the church,\r","though he is not seen by day\r","     \r","and whether for good, or whether for ill,\r","it is not mine to say;\r","but still with the house of amundeville\r","he abideth night and day\r","by the marriage-bed of their lords, 'tis said,\r","he flits on the bridal eve;\r","and 'tis held as faith, to their bed of death\r","he comesbut not to grieve\r","when an heir is born, he's heard to mourn,\r","and when aught is to befall\r","that ancient line, in the 'we moonshine\r","he walks from hall to hall\r","his form you may trace, but not his face,\r","'tis shadow'd by his cowl;\r","but his eyes may be seen from the folds between,\r","and they seem of a parted soul\r","but beware! beware! of the black friar,\r","he still retains his sway,\r","for he is yet the church's heir\r","whoever may be the lay\r","amundeville is lord by day,\r","but the monk is lord by night;\r","nor wine nor wassail could raise a vassal\r","to question that friar's right\r","say nought to him as he walks the hall,\r","and he'll say nought to you;\r","he sweeps along in his dusky pall,\r","as o'er the grass the dew\r","then grammercy! for the black friar;\r","heaven sain him, fair or foul!\r","and whatsoe'er may be his prayer,\r","let ours be for his soul\r","the lady's voice ceased, and the thrilling wires\r","died from the touch that kindled them to sound;\r","and the pause follow'd, which when song expires\r","pervades a moment those who listen round;\r","and then of course the circle much admires,\r","   \r","nor less applauds, as in politeness bound,\r","the tones, the feeling, and the execution,\r","to the performer's diffident confusion\r","fair adeline, though in a careless way,\r","as if she rated such accomplishment\r","as the mere pastime of an idle day,\r","pursued an instant for her own content,\r","would now and then as 'twere without display,\r","yet with display in fact, at times relent\r","to such performances with haughty smile,\r","to show she could, if it were worth her while\r","now this but we will whisper it aside\r","waspardon the pedantic illustration--\r","trampling on plato's pride with greater pride,\r","as did the cynic on some like occasion;\r","deeming the sage would be much mortified,\r","or thrown into a philosophic passion,\r","for a spoil'd carpetbut the 'attic bee'\r","was much consoled by his own repartee\r","thus adeline would throw into the shade\r","by doing easily, whene'er she chose,\r","what dilettanti do with vast parade\r","their sort of half profession; for it grows\r","to something like this when too oft display'd;\r","and that it is so everybody knows\r","who have heard miss that or this, or lady t'other,\r","show offto please their company or mother\r","oh! the long evenings of duets and trios!\r","the admirations and the speculations;\r","the 'mamma mia's!' and the 'amor mio's!'\r","the 'tanti palpiti's' on such occasions:\r","the 'lasciami's,' and quavering

with dreams that they are nigh lands,\r","no more to be beheld but in such visions -\r","was adeline well versed, as compositions\r","she also had a twilight tinge of 'blue,'\r","could write rhymes, and compose more than she wrote,\r","made epigrams occasionally too\r","upon her friends, as everybody ought\r","but still from that sublimer azure hue,\r","so much the present dye, she was remote;\r","was weak enough to deem pope a great poet,\r","and what was worse, was not ashamed to show it\r","aurorasince we are touching upon taste,\r","which now-a-days is the thermometer\r","by whose degrees all characters are class'd -\r","was more shakspearian, if i do not err\r","the worlds beyond this world's perplexing waste\r","had more of her existence, for in her\r","there was a depth of feeling to embrace\r","thoughts, boundless, deep, but silent too as space\r","not so her gracious, graceful, graceless grace,\r","the full-grown hebe of fitz-fulke, whose mind,\r","if she had any, was upon her face,\r","and that was of a fascinating kind\r","a little turn for mischief you might trace\r","also thereon,--but that's not much; we find\r","few females without some such gentle leaven,\r","for fear we should suppose us quite in heaven\r","i have not heard she was at all poetic,\r","though once she was seen reading the 'bath guide,'\r","and 'hayley's triumphs,' which she deem'd pathetic,\r","because she said her temper had been tried\r","so much, the bard had really been propheti\r","of what she had gone through withsince a bride\r","but of all verse, what most ensured her praise\r","were sonnets to herself, or 'bouts rimes'\r","  \r","'twere difficult to say what was the object\r","of adeline, in bringing this same lay\r","to bear on what appear'd to her the subject\r","of juan's nervous feelings on that day\r","perhaps she merely had the simple project\r","to laugh him out of his supposed dismay;\r","perhaps she might wish to confirm him in it,\r","though why i cannot sayat least this minute\r","but so far the immediate effect\r","was to restore him to his self -propriety,\r","a thing quite necessary to the elect,\r","who wish to take the tone of their society:\r","in which you cannot be too circumspect,\r","whether the mode be persiflage or piety,\r","but wear the newest mantle of hypocrisy,\r","on pain of much displeasing the gynocracy\r","and therefore juan now began to rally\r","his spirits, and without more explanation\r","to jest upon such themes in many a sally\r","her grace, too, also seized the same occasion,\r","with various similar remarks to tally,\r","but wish'd for a still more detail'd narration\r","of this same mystic friar's curious doings,\r","about the present family's deaths and wooings\r","of these few could say more than has been said;\r","they pass'd as such things do, for superstition\r","with some, while others, who had more in dread\r","the theme, half credited the strange tradition;\r","and much was talk'd on all sides on that head:\r","but juan, when cross-question'd on the vision,\r","which some supposed though he had not avow'd it\r","had stirr'd him, answer'd in a way to cloud it\r","and then, the mid-day having worn to one,\r","the company prepared to separate;\r","some to their several pastimes, or to none,\r","some wondering 'twas so early, some so late\r","there was a goodly match too, to be run\r","    \r","between some greyhounds on my lord's estate,\r","and a young race-horse of old pedigree\r","match'd for the spring, whom several went to see\r","there was a picture-dealer who had brought\r","a special titian, warranted original,\r","so precious that it was not to be bought,\r","though princes the possessor were besieging all\r","the king himself had cheapen'd it, but thought\r","the civil list he deigns to accept obliging all\r","his subjects by his gracious acceptation\r","too scanty, in these times of low taxation\r","but as lord henry was a connoisseur,--\r","the friend of artists, if not arts,--the owner,\r","with motives the most classical and pure,\r","so that he would have been the very donor,\r","rather than seller, had his wants been fewer,\r","so much he deem'd his patronage an honour,\r","had brought the capo d'opera, not for sale,\r","but for his judgmentnever known to fail\r","there was a modern goth, i mean a gothi\r","bricklayer of babel, call'd an architect,\r","brought to survey these grey walls, which though so thick,\r","might have from time acquired some slight defect;\r","who after rummaging the abbey through thick\r","and thin, produced a plan whereby to erect\r","new buildings of correctest conformation,\r","and throw down oldwhich he call'd restoration\r","the cost would be a triflean 'old song,'\r","set to some thousands 'tis the usual burden\r","of that same tune, when people hum it long--\r","the price would speedily repay its worth in\r","an edifice no less sublime than strong,\r","by which lord henry's good taste would go forth in\r","its glory, through all ages shining sunny,\r","for gothic daring shown in english money\r","there were two lawyers busy on a mortgage\r","lord henry wish'd to raise for a new purchase;\r","      \r","also a lawsuit upon tenures burgage,\r","and one on tithes, which sure are discord's torches,\r","kindling religion till she throws down her gage,\r","'untying' squires 'to fight against the churches;'\r","there was a prize ox, a prize pig, and ploughman,\r","for henry was a sort of sabine showman\r","there were two poachers caught in a steel trap,\r","ready for gaol, their place of convalescence;\r","there was a country girl in a close cap\r","and scarlet cloak i hate the sight to see, since--\r","since--since--in youth, i had the sad mishap--\r","but luckily i have paid few parish fees since:\r","that scarlet cloak, alas! unclosed with rigour,\r","presents the problem of a double figure\r","a reel within a bottle is a mystery,\r","one can't tell how it e'er got in or out;\r","therefore the present piece of natural history\r","i leave to those who are fond of soing doubt;\r","and merely state, though not for the consistory,\r","lord henry was a justice, and that scout\r","the constable, beneath a warrant's banner,\r","had bagg'd this poacher upon nature's manor\r","now justices of peace must judge all pieces\r","of mischief of all kinds, and keep the game\r","and morals of the country from caprices\r","of those who have not a license for the same;\r","and of all things, excepting tithes and leases,\r","perhaps these are most difficult to tame:\r","preserving partridges and pretty wenches\r","are puzzles to the most precautious benches\r","the present culprit was extremely pale,\r","pale as if painted so; her cheek being red\r","by nature, as in higher dames less hale\r","'tis white, at least when they just rise from bed\r","perhaps she was ashamed of seeming frail,\r","poor soul! for she was country born and bred,\r","and knew no better in her immorality\r","than to wax whitefor blushes are for quality\r","her black, bright, downcast, yet espiegle eye,\r","had gather'd a large tear into its corner,\r","which the poor thing at times essay'd to dry,\r","for she was not a sentimental mourner\r","parading all her sensibility,\r","nor insolent enough to scorn the scorner,\r","but stood in trembling, patient tribulation,\r","to be call'd up for her examination\r","of course these groups were scatter'd here and there,\r","not nigh the gay saloon of ladies gent\r","the lawyers in the study; and in air\r","the prize pig, ploughman, poachers; the men sent\r","from town, viz, architect and dealer, were\r","both busy as a general in his tent\r","writing despatches in their several stations,\r","exulting in their brilliant lucubrations\r","but this poor girl was left in the great hall,\r","while scout, the parish guardian of the frail,\r","discuss'd he hated beer yclept the 'small'\r","a mighty mug of moral double ale\r","she waited until justice could recall\r","its kind attentions to their proper pale,\r","to name a thing in nomenclature rather\r","perplexing for most virginsa child's father\r","you see here was enough of occupation\r","for the lord henry, link'd with dogs and horses\r","there was much bustle too, and preparation\r","below stairs on the score of second courses;\r","because, as suits their rank and situation,\r","those who in counties have great land resources\r","have 'public days,' when all men may carouse,\r","though not exactly what's call'd 'open house'\r","but once a week or fortnight, uninvited\r","thus we translate a general invitation,\r","all country gentlemen, esquired or knighted,\r","may drop in without cards, and take their station\r","at the full board, and sit alike delighted\r"," \r","with fashionable wines and conversation;\r","and, as the isthmus of the grand connection,\r","talk o'er themsees the past and next election\r","lord henry was a great electioneerer,\r","burrowing for boroughs like a rat or rabbit;\r","but county contests cost him rather dearer,\r","because the neighbouring scotch earl of giftgabbit\r","had english influence in the self-same sphere here;\r","his son, the honourable dick dicedrabbit,\r","was member for the 'other interest' meaning\r","the same self-interest, with a different leaning\r","courteous and cautious therefore in his county,\r","he was all things to all men, and dispensed\r","to some civility, to others bounty,\r","and promises to allwhich last commenced\r","to gather to a somewhat large amount, he\r","not calculating how much they condensed;\r","but what with keeping some, and breaking others,\r","his word had the same value as another's\r","a friend to freedom and freeholders--yet\r","no less a friend to government--he held,\r","that he exactly the just medium hit\r","'twixt place and patriotism--albeit compell'd,\r","such was his sovereign's pleasure though unfit,\r","he added modestly, when rebels rail'd,\r","to hold some sinecures he wish'd abolish'd,\r","but that with them all law would be demolish'd\r","he was 'free to confess' whence comes this phrase?\r","is't english? no--'tis only parliamentary\r","that innovation's spirit now-a-days\r","had made more progress than for the last century\r","he would not tread a factious path to praise,\r","though for the public weal disposed to venture high;\r","as for his place, he could but say this of it,\r","that the fatigue was greater than the profit\r","heaven, and his friends, knew that a private life\r","had ever been his sole and whole ambition;\r","but could he quit his king in times of strife,\r","which threaten'd the whole country with perdition?\r","when demagogues would with a butcher's knife\r","cut through and through oh! damnable incision!\r","the gordian or the geordi-an knot, whose strings\r","have tied together commons, lords, and kings\r","sooner 'come lace into the civil list\r","and champion him to the utmost'--he would keep it,\r","till duly disappointed or dismiss'd:\r","profit he care not for, let others reap it;\r","but should the day come when place ceased to exist,\r","the country would have far more cause to weep it:\r","for how could it go on? explain who can!\r","he gloried in the name of englishman\r","he was as independent--ay, much more--\r","than those who were not paid for independence,\r","as common soldiers, or a common--shore,\r","have in their several arts or parts ascendance\r","o'er the irregulars in lust or gore,\r","who do not give professional attendance\r","thus on the mob all statesmen are as eager\r","to prove their pride, as footmen to a beggar\r","all this save the last stanza henry said,\r","and thought i say no more--i've said too much;\r","for all of us have either heard or read--\r","off--or upon the hustings--some slight such\r","hints from the independent heart or head\r","of the official candidate i'll touch\r","no more on this--the dinner-bell hath rung,\r","and grace is said; the grace i should have sung--\r","but i'm too late, and therefore must make play\r","'twas a great banquet, such as albion old\r","was wont to boast--as if a glutton's tray\r","were something very glorious to behold\r","but 'twas a public feast and public day,--\r","quite full, right dull, guests hot, and dishes cold,\r","great plenty, much formality, small cheer,\r","and every body out of their own sphere\r","the squires familiarly formal, and\r","my lords and ladies proudly condescending;\r","the very servants puzzling how to hand\r","their plates--without it might be too much bending\r","from their high places by the sideboard's stand--\r","yet, like their masters, fearful of offending\r","for any deviation from the graces\r","might cost both man and master too--their places\r","there were some hunters bold, and coursers keen,\r","whose hounds ne'er err'd, nor greyhounds deign'd to lurch;\r","some deadly shots too, septembrizers, seen\r","earliest to rise, and last to quit the search\r","of the poor partridge through his stubble screen\r","there were some massy members of the church,\r","takers of tithes, and makers of good matches,\r","and several who sung fewer psalms than catches\r","there were some country wags tooand, alas!\r","some exiles from the town, who had been driven\r","to gaze, instead of pavement, upon grass,\r","and rise at nine in lieu of long eleven\r","and lo! upon that day it came to pass,\r","i sate next that o'erwhelming son of heaven,\r","the very powerful parson, peter pith,\r","the loudest wit i e'er was deafen'd with\r","i knew him in his livelier london days,\r","a brilliant diner out, though but a curate;\r","and not a joke he cut but earn'd its praise,\r","until preferment, coming at a sure rate\r","o providence! how wondrous are thy ways!\r","who would suppose thy gifts sometimes obdurate?,\r","gave him, to lay the devil who looks o'er lincoln,\r","a fat fen vicarage, and nought to think on\r","his jokes were sermons, and his sermons jokes;\r","but both were thrown away amongst the fens;\r","for wit hath no great friend in aguish folks\r","no longer ready ears and short-hand pens\r","imbibed the gay bon-mot, or happy hoax:\r","      \r","the poor priest was reduced to common sense,\r","or to coarse efforts very loud and long,\r","to hammer a horse laugh from the thick throng\r","there is a difference, says the song, 'between\r","a beggar and a queen,' or was of late\r","the latter worse used of the two we've seen--\r","but we'll say nothing of affairs of state;\r","a difference ''twixt a bishop and a dean,'\r","a difference between crockery ware and plate,\r","as between english beef and spartan broth--\r","and yet great heroes have been bred by both\r","but of all nature's discrepancies, none\r","upon the whole is greater than the difference\r","beheld between the country and the town,\r","of which the latter merits every preference\r","from those who have few resources of their own,\r","and only think, or act, or feel, with reference\r","to some small plan of interest or ambition--\r","both which are limited to no condition\r","but 'en avant!' the light loves languish o'er\r","long banquets and too many guests, although\r","a slight repast makes people love much more,\r","bacchus and ceres being, as we know\r","even from our grammar upwards, friends of yore\r","with vivifying venus, who doth owe\r","to these the invention of champagne and truffles:\r","temperance delights her, but long fasting ruffles\r","dully past o'er the dinner of the day;\r","and juan took his place, he knew not where,\r","confused, in the confusion, and distrait,\r","and sitting as if nail'd upon his chair:\r","though knives and forks clank'd round as in a fray,\r","he seem'd unconscious of all passing there,\r","till some one, with a groan, exprest a wish\r","unheeded twice to have a fin of fish\r","on which, at the third asking of the bans,\r","he started; and perceiving smiles around\r","broadening to grins, he colour'd more than once,\r","and hastily--as nothing can confound\r","a wise man more than laughter from a dunce--\r","inflicted on the dish a deadly wound,\r","and with such hurry, that ere he could curb it\r","he had paid his neighbour's prayer with half a turbot\r","this was no bad mistake, as it occurr'd,\r","the supplicator being an amateur;\r","but others, who were left with scarce a third,\r","were angry--as they well might, to be sure\r","they wonder'd how a young man so absurd\r","lord henry at his table should endure;\r","and this, and his not knowing how much oats\r","had fallen last market, cost his host three votes\r","they little knew, or might have sympathised,\r","that he the night before had seen a ghost,\r","a prologue which but slightly harmonised\r","with the substantial company engross'd\r","by matter, and so much materialised,\r","that one scarce knew at what to marvel most\r","of two things--how the question rather odd is\r","such bodies could have souls, or souls such bodies\r","but what confused him more than smile or stare\r","from all the 'squires and 'squiresses around,\r","who wonder'd at the abstraction of his air,\r","especially as he had been renown'd\r","for some vivacity among the fair,\r","even in the country circle's narrow bound\r","for little things upon my lord's estate\r","were good small talk for others still less great--\r","was, that he caught aurora's eye on his,\r","and something like a smile upon her cheek\r","now this he really rather took amiss:\r","in those who rarely smile, their smiles bespeak\r","a strong external motive; and in this\r","smile of aurora's there was nought to pique\r","or hope, or love, with any of the wiles\r","which some pretend to trace in ladies' smiles\r","  \r","'twas a mere quiet smile of contemplation,\r","indicative of some surprise and pity;\r","and juan grew carnation with vexation,\r","which was not very wise, and still less witty,\r","since he had gain'd at least her observation,\r","a most important outwork of the city--\r","as juan should have known, had not his senses\r","by last night's ghost been driven from their defences\r","but what was bad, she did not blush in turn,\r","nor seem embarrass'd--quite the contrary;\r","her aspect was as usual, still--not stern--\r","and she withdrew, but cast not down, her eye,\r","yet grew a little pale--with what? concern?\r","i know not; but her colour ne'er was high--\r","though sometimes faintly flush'd--and always clear,\r","as deep seas in a sunny atmosphere\r","but adeline was occupied by fame\r","this day; and watching, witching, condescending\r","to the consumers of fish, fowl, and game,\r","and dignity with courtesy so blending,\r","as all must blend whose part it is to aim\r","especially as the sixth year is ending\r","at their lord's, son's, or similar connection's\r","safe conduct through the rocks of re-elections\r","though this was most expedient on the whole,\r","and usual--juan, when he cast a glance\r","on adeline while playing her grand role,\r","which she went through as though it were a dance,\r","betraying only now and then her soul\r","by a look scarce perceptibly askance\r","of weariness or scorn, began to feel\r","some doubt how much of adeline was real;\r","so well she acted all and every part\r","by turns--with that vivacious versatility,\r","which many people take for want of heart\r","they err--'tis merely what is call'd mobility,\r","a thing of temperament and not of art,\r","  \r","though seeming so, from its supposed facility;\r","and false--though true; for surely they 're sincerest\r","who are strongly acted on by what is nearest\r","this makes your actors, artists, and romancers,\r","heroes sometimes, though seldom--sages never;\r","but speakers, bards, diplomatists, and dancers,\r","little that's great, but much of what is clever;\r","most orators, but very few financiers,\r","though all exchequer chancellors endeavour,\r","of late years, to dispense with cocker's rigours,\r","and grow quite figurative with their figures\r","the poets of arithmetic are they\r","who, though they prove not two and two to be\r","five, as they might do in a modest way,\r","have plainly made it out that four are three,\r","judging by what they take, and what they pay\r","the sinking fund's unfathomable sea,\r","that most unliquidating liquid, leaves\r","the debt unsunk, yet sinks all it receives\r","while adeline dispensed her airs and graces,\r","the fair fitz-fulke seem'd very much at ease;\r","though too well bred to quiz men to their faces,\r","her laughing blue eyes with a glance could seize\r","the ridicules of people in all places -\r","that honey of your fashionable bees -\r","and store it up for mischievous enjoyment;\r","and this at present was her kind employment\r","however, the day closed, as days must close;\r","the evening also wanedand coffee came\r","each carriage was announced, and ladies rose,\r","and curtsying off, as curtsies country dame,\r","retired: with most unfashionable bows\r","their docile esquires also did the same,\r","delighted with their dinner and their host,\r","but with the lady adeline the most\r","some praised her beauty; others her great grace;\r","the warmth of her politeness, whose sincerity\r"," \r","was obvious in each feature of her face,\r","whose traits were radiant with the rays of verity\r","yes; she was truly worthy her high place!\r","no one could envy her deserved prosperity\r","and then her dresswhat beautiful simplicity\r","draperied her form with curious felicity!\r","meanwhile sweet adeline deserved their praises,\r","by an impartial indemnification\r","for all her past exertion and soft phrases,\r","in a most edifying conversation,\r","which turn'd upon their late guests' miens and faces,\r","and families, even to the last relation;\r","their hideous wives, their horrid sees and dresses,\r","and truculent distortion of their tresses\r","true, she said little'twas the rest that broke\r","forth into universal epigram;\r","but then 'twas to the purpose what she spoke:\r","like addison's 'faint praise,' so wont to damn,\r","her own but served to set off every joke,\r","as music chimes in with a melodrame\r","how sweet the task to shield an absent friend!\r","i ask but this of mine, tonot defend\r","there were but two exceptions to this keen\r","skirmish of wits o'er the departed; one\r","aurora, with her pure and placid mien;\r","and juan, too, in general behind none\r","in gay remark on what he had heard or seen,\r","sate silent now, his usual spirits gone:\r","in vain he heard the others rail or rally,\r","he would not join them in a single sally\r","'tis true he saw aurora look as though\r","she approved his silence; she perhaps mistook\r","its motive for that charity we owe\r","but seldom pay the absent, nor would look\r","fartherit might or might not be so\r","but juan, sitting silent in his nook,\r","observing little in his reverie,\r","yet saw this much, which he was glad to see\r"," \r","the ghost at least had done him this much good,\r","in making him as silent as a ghost,\r","if in the circumstances which ensued\r","he gain'd esteem where it was worth the most\r","and certainly aurora had renew'd\r","in him some feelings he had lately lost,\r","or harden'd; feelings which, perhaps ideal,\r","are so divine, that i must deem them real:--\r","the love of higher things and better days;\r","the unbounded hope, and heavenly ignorance\r","of what is call'd the world, and the world's ways;\r","the moments when we gather from a glance\r","more joy than from all future pride or praise,\r","which kindle manhood, but can ne'er entrance\r","the heart in an existence of its own,\r","of which another's bosom is the zone\r","who would not sigh ai ai tan kuuerheian\r","that hath a memory, or that had a heart?\r","alas! her star must fade like that of dian:\r","ray fades on ray, as years on years depart\r","anacreon only had the soul to tie an\r","unwithering myrtle round the unblunted dart\r","of eros: but though thou hast play'd us many tricks,\r","still we respect thee, 'alma venus genetrix!'\r","and full of sentiments, sublime as billows\r","heaving between this world and worlds beyond,\r","don juan, when the midnight hour of pillows\r","arrived, retired to his; but to despond\r","rather than rest instead of poppies, willows\r","waved o'er his couch; he meditated, fond\r","of those sweet bitter thoughts which banish sleep,\r","and make the worldling sneer, the youngling weep\r","the night was as before: he was undrest,\r","saving his night-gown, which is an undress;\r","completely 'sans culotte,' and without vest;\r","in short, he hardly could be clothed with less:\r","but apprehensive of his spectral guest,\r","he sate with feelings awkward to express\r","by those who have not had such visitations,\r","expectant of the ghost's fresh operations\r","and not in vain he listen'd;--hush! what's that?\r","i see--i see--ah, no!--'tis not--yet 'tis--\r","ye powers! it is the-the-the-pooh! the cat!\r","the devil may take that stealthy pace of his!\r","so like a spiritual pit-a-pat,\r","or tiptoe of an amatory miss,\r","gliding the first time to a rendezvous,\r","and dreading the chaste echoes of her shoe\r","again--what is't? the wind? no, no--this time\r","it is the sable friar as before,\r","with awful footsteps regular as rhyme,\r","or as rhymes may be in these days much more\r","again through shadows of the night sublime,\r","when deep sleep fell on men, and the world wore\r","the starry darkness round her like a girdle\r","spangled with gems--the monk made his blood curdle\r","a noise like to wet fingers drawn on glass,\r","which sets the teeth on edge; and a slight clatter,\r","like showers which on the midnight gusts will pass,\r","sounding like very supernatural water,\r","came over juan's ear, which throbb'd, alas!\r","for immaterialism's a serious matter;\r","so that even those whose faith is the most great\r","in souls immortal, shun them tete-a-tete\r","were his eyes open?--yes! and his mouth too\r","surprise has this effect--to make one dumb,\r","yet leave the gate which eloquence slips through\r","as wide as if a long speech were to come\r","nigh and more nigh the awful echoes drew,\r","tremendous to a mortal tympanum:\r","his eyes were open, and as was before\r","stated his mouth what open'd next?--the door\r","it open'd with a most infernal creak,\r","like that of hell 'lasciate ogni speranza\r","voi che entrate!' the hinge seem'd to speak,\r","dreadful as dante's rhima, or this stanza;\r","orbut all words upon such themes are weak:\r","a single shade's sufficient to entrance\r","herofor what is substance to a spirit?\r","or how is't matter trembles to come near it?\r","the door flew wide,--not swiftly, but, as fly\r","the sea -gulls, with a steady, sober flight,\r","and then swung back, nor close, but stood awry,\r","half letting in long shadows on the light,\r","which still in juan's candlesticks burned high,\r","for he had two, both tolerably bright,\r","and in the doorway, darkening darkness, stood\r","the sable friar in his solemn hood\r","between two worlds life hovers like a star,\r","'twixt night and morn, upon the horizon's verge\r","how little do we know that which we are!\r","how less what we may be! the eternal surge\r","of time and tide rolls on, and bears afar\r","our bubbles; as the old burst, new emerge,\r","lash'd from the foam of ages; while the graves\r","of empires heave but like some passing waves\r","don juan shook, as erst he had been shaken\r","the night before, but being sick of shaking,\r","he first inclined to think he had been mistaken,\r","and then to be ashamed of such mistaking\r","his own internal ghost began to awaken\r","within him and to quell his corporal quaking,\r","hinting that soul and body on the whole\r","were odds against a disembodied soul\r","and then his dread grew wrath, and his wrath fierce,\r","and he arose, advanced the shade retreated,\r","but juan, eager now the truth to pierce,\r","followed, his veins no longer cold, but heated,\r","resoed to thrust the mystery carte and tierce,\r","at whatsoever risk of being defeated\r","the ghost stopped, menaced, then retired, until\r","he reached the ancient wall, then stood stone still\r","juan put forth one arm eternal powers!\r","it touched no soul nor body, but the wall,\r","on which the moonbeams fell in siery showers\r","checkered with all the tracery of the hall\r","he shuddered, as no doubt the bravest cowers\r","when he can't tell what 'tis that doth appal\r","how odd, a single hobgoblin's nonentity\r","should cause more fear than a whole host's identity\r","but still the shade remained, the blue eyes glared,\r","and rather variably for stony death\r","yet one thing rather good the grave had spared;\r","the ghost had a remarkably sweet breath\r","a straggling curl showed he had been fair-haired\r","a red lip with two rows of pearls beneath\r","gleamed forth, as through the casement's ivy shroud\r","the moon peeped, just escaped from a grey cloud\r","and juan, puzzled but still curious, thrust\r","his other arm forth wonder upon wonder!\r","it pressed upon a hard but glowing bust,\r","which beat as if there was a warm heart under\r","he found, as people on most trials must,\r","that he had made at first a silly blunder\r","and that in his confusion he had caught\r","only the wall, instead of what he sought\r","the ghost, if ghost it were, seemed a sweet soul\r","as ever lurked beneath a holy hood\r","a dimpled chin, a neck of ivory stole\r","forth into something much like flesh and blood\r","back fell the sable frock and dreary cowl\r","and they revealed, alas, that ere they should,\r","in full, voluptuous, but not o'ergrown bulk,\r","the phantom of her frolic gracefita-fulke!\r","\r","don juan: canto the sixth\r","'there is a tide in the affairs of men\r","which,--taken at the flood,'--you know the rest,\r","and most of us have found it now and then;\r","at least we think so, though but few have

array,\r","had bow'd themsees before th' imperial eyes,\r","and at the usual signal ta'en their way\r","back to their chambers, those long galleries\r","in the seraglio, where the ladies lay\r","their delicate limbs; a thousand bosoms there\r","beating for love, as the caged bird's for air\r","i love the sex, and sometimes would reverse\r","the tyrant's wish, 'that mankind only had\r","one neck,

love\r","  \r","in which we left him several lines above\r","he went forth with the lovely odalisques,\r","at the given signal join'd to their array;\r","and though he certainly ran many risks,\r","yet he could not at times keep, by the way\r","although the consequences of such frisks\r","are worse than the worst damages men pay\r","in moral england, where the thing 's a tax,\r","from ogling all their charms from breasts to backs\r","still he forgot not his disguise:- along\r","the galleries from room to room they walk'd,\r","a virgin-like and edifying throng,\r","by eunuchs flank'd; while at their head there stalk'd\r","a dame who kept up discipline among\r","the female ranks, so that none stirr'd or talk'd\r","without her sanction on their she-parades:\r","her title was 'the mother of the maids'\r","whether she was a 'mother,' i know not,\r","or whether they were 'maids' who call'd her mother;\r","but this is her seraglio title, got\r","i know not how, but good as any other;\r","so cantemir can tell you, or de tott:\r","her office was to keep aloof or smother\r","all bad propensities in fifteen hundred\r","young women, and correct them when they blunder'd\r","a goodly sinecure, no doubt! but made\r","more easy by the absence of all men-\r","except his majesty, who, with her aid,\r","and guards, and bolts, and walls, and now and then\r","a slight example, just to cast a shade\r","along the rest, contrived to keep this den\r","of beauties cool as an italian convent,\r","where all the passions have, alas! but one vent\r","and what is that? devotion, doubtless- how\r","could you ask such a question?- but we will\r","continue as i said, this goodly row\r","of ladies of all countries at the will\r"," \r","of one good man, with stately march and slow,\r","like water-lilies floating down a rill-\r","or rather lake, for rills do not run slowly-\r","paced on most maiden-like and melancholy\r","but when they reach'd their own apartments, there,\r","like birds, or boys, or bedlamites broke loose,\r","waves at spring-tide, or women anywhere\r","when freed from bonds which are of no great use\r","after all, or like irish at a fair,\r","their guards being gone, and as it were a truce\r","establish'd between them and bondage, they\r","began to sing, dance, chatter, smile, and play\r","their talk, of course, ran most on the new comer;\r","her shape, her hair, her air, her everything:\r","some thought her dress did not so much become her,\r","or wonder'd at her ears without a ring;\r","some said her years were getting nigh their summer,\r","others contended they were but in spring;\r","some thought her rather masculine in height,\r","while others wish'd that she had been so quite\r","but no one doubted on the whole, that she\r","was what her dress bespoke, a damsel fair,\r","and fresh, and 'beautiful exceedingly,'\r","who with the brightest georgians might compare:\r","they wonder'd how gulbeyaz, too, could be\r","so silly as to buy slaves who might share\r","if that his highness wearied of his bride\r","her throne and power, and every thing beside\r","but what was strangest in this virgin crew,\r","although her beauty was enough to vex,\r","after the first investigating view,\r","they all found out as few, or fewer, specks\r","in the fair form of their companion new,\r","than is the custom of the gentle sex,\r","when they survey, with christian eyes or heathen,\r","in a new face 'the ugliest creature breathing'\r","and yet they had their little jealousies,\r","like all the rest; but upon this occasion,\r","whether there are such things as sympathies\r","without our knowledge or our approbation,\r","although they could not see through his disguise,\r","all felt a soft kind of concatenation,\r","like magnetism, or devilism, or what\r","you please- we will not quarrel about that:\r","but certain 't is they all felt for their new\r","companion something newer still, as 't were\r","a sentimental friendship through and through,\r","extremely pure, which made them all concur\r","in wishing her their sister, save a few\r","who wish'd they had a brother just like her,\r","whom, if they were at home in sweet circassia,\r","they would prefer to padisha or pacha\r","of those who had most genius for this sort\r","of sentimental friendship, there were three,\r","lolah, katinka, and dudu; in short\r","to save description, fair as fair can be\r","were they, according to the best report,\r","though differing in stature and degree,\r","and clime and time, and country and complexion;\r","they all alike admired their new connection\r","lolah was dusk as india and as warm;\r","katinka was a georgian, white and red,\r","with great blue eyes, a lovely hand and arm,\r","and feet so small they scarce seem'd made to tread,\r","but rather skim the earth; while dudu's form\r","look'd more adapted to be put to bed,\r","being somewhat large, and languishing, and lazy,\r","yet of a beauty that would drive you crazy\r","a kind of sleepy venus seem'd dudu,\r","yet very fit to 'murder sleep' in those\r","who gazed upon her cheek's transcendent hue,\r","her attic forehead, and her phidian nose:\r","few angles were there in her form, 't is true,\r","thinner she might have been, and yet scarce lose;\r","yet, after all, 't would puzzle to say where\r","it would not spoil some separate charm to pare\r","she was not violently lively, but\r","stole on your spirit like a may-day breaking;\r","her eyes were not too sparkling, yet, half-shut,\r","they put beholders in a tender taking;\r","she look'd this simile 's quite new just cut\r","from marble, like pygmalion's statue waking,\r","the mortal and the marble still at strife,\r","and timidly expanding into life\r","lolah demanded the new damsel's name-\r","'juanna'- well, a pretty name enough\r","katinka ask'd her also whence she came-\r","'from spain'- 'but where is spain?'- 'don't ask such stuff,\r","nor show your georgian ignorance- for shame!'\r","said lolah, with an accent rather rough,\r","to poor katinka: 'spain 's an island near\r","morocco, betwixt egypt and tangier'\r","dudu said nothing, but sat down beside\r","juanna, playing with her veil or hair;\r","and looking at her steadfastly, she sigh'd,\r","as if she pitied her for being there,\r","a pretty stranger without friend or guide,\r","and all abash'd, too, at the general stare\r","which welcomes hapless strangers in all places,\r","with kind remarks upon their mien and faces\r","but here the mother of the maids drew near,\r","with, 'ladies, it is time to go to rest\r","i 'm puzzled what to do with you, my dear,'\r","she added to juanna, their new guest:\r","'your coming has been unexpected here,\r","and every couch is occupied; you had best\r","partake of mine; but by to-morrow early\r","we will have all things settled for you fairly'\r","here lolah interposed- 'mamma, you know\r","you don't sleep soundly, and i cannot bear\r","that anybody should disturb you so;\r","i 'll take juanna; we 're a slenderer pair\r","        \r","than you would make the half of;- don't say no;\r","and i of your young charge will take due care'\r","but here katinka interfered, and said,\r","'she also had compassion and a bed\r","'besides, i hate to sleep alone,' quoth she\r","the matron frown'd: 'why so?'- 'for fear of ghosts,'\r","replied katinka; 'i am sure i see\r","a phantom upon each of the four posts;\r","and then i have the worst dreams that can be,\r","of guebres, giaours, and ginns, and gouls in hosts'\r","the dame replied, 'between your dreams and you,\r","i fear juanna's dreams would be but few\r","'you, lolah, must continue still to lie\r","alone, for reasons which don't matter; you\r","the same, katinka, until by and by;\r","and i shall place juanna with dudu,\r","who 's quiet, inoffensive, silent, shy,\r","and will not toss and chatter the night through\r","what say you, child?'- dudu said nothing, as\r","her talents were of the more silent class;\r","but she rose up, and kiss'd the matron's brow\r","between the eyes, and lolah on both cheeks,\r","katinka, too; and with a gentle bow\r","curt'sies are neither used by turks nor greeks\r","she took juanna by the hand to show\r","their place of rest, and left to both their piques,\r","the others pouting at the matron's preference\r","of dudu, though they held their tongues from deference\r","it was a spacious chamber oda is\r","the turkish title, and ranged round the wall\r","were couches, toilets- and much more than this\r","i might describe, as i have seen it all,\r","but it suffices- little was amiss;\r","'t was on the whole a nobly furnish'd hall,\r","with all things ladies want, save one or two,\r","and even those were nearer than they knew\r","dudu, as has been said, was a sweet creature,\r","   \r","not very dashing, but extremely winning,\r","with the most regulated charms of feature,\r","which painters cannot catch like faces sinning\r","against proportion- the wild strokes of nature\r","which they hit off at once in the beginning,\r","full of expression, right or wrong, that strike,\r","and pleasing or unpleasing, still are like\r","but she was a soft landscape of mild earth,\r","where all was harmony, and calm, and quiet,\r","luxuriant, budding; cheerful without mirth,\r","which, if not happiness, is much more nigh it\r","than are your mighty passions and so forth,\r","which some call 'the sublime:' i wish they 'd try it:\r","i 've seen your stormy seas and stormy women,\r","and pity lovers rather more than seamen\r","but she was pensive more than melancholy,\r","and serious more than pensive, and serene,\r","it may be, more than either- not unholy\r","her thoughts, at least till now, appear to have been\r","the strangest thing was, beauteous, she was wholly\r","unconscious, albeit turn'd of quick seventeen,\r","that she was fair, or dark, or short, or tall;\r","she never thought about herself at all\r","and therefore was she kind and gentle as\r","the age of gold when gold was yet unknown,\r","by which its nomenclature came to pass;\r","thus most appropriately has been shown\r","'lucus a non lucendo,' not what was,\r","but what was not; a sort of style that 's grown\r","extremely common in this age, whose metal\r","the devil may decompose, but never settle:\r","i think it may be of 'corinthian brass,'\r","which was a mixture of all metals, but\r","the brazen uppermost kind reader! pass\r","this long parenthesis: i could not shut\r","it sooner for the soul of me, and class\r","my faults even with your own! which meaneth, put\r","a kind construction upon them and me:\r"," \r","but that you won't- then don't- i am not less free\r","'t is time we should return to plain narration,\r","and thus my narrative proceeds:- dudu,\r","with every kindness short of ostentation,\r","show'd juan, or juanna, through and through\r","this labyrinth of females, and each station\r","described- what 's strange- in words extremely few:\r","i have but one simile, and that 's a blunder,\r","for wordless woman, which is silent thunder\r","and next she gave her i say her, because\r","the gender still was epicene, at least\r","in outward show, which is a saving clause\r","an outline of the customs of the east,\r","with all their chaste integrity of laws,\r","by which the more a haram is increased,\r","the stricter doubtless grow the vestal duties\r","of any supernumerary beauties\r","and then she gave juanna a chaste kiss:\r","dudu was fond of kissing- which i 'm sure\r","that nobody can ever take amiss,\r","because 't is pleasant, so that it be pure,\r","and between females means no more than this-\r","that they have nothing better near, or newer\r","'kiss' rhymes to 'bliss' in fact as well as verse-\r","i wish it never led to something worse\r","in perfect innocence she then unmade\r","her toilet, which cost little, for she was\r","a child of nature, carelessly array'd:\r","if fond of a chance ogle at her glass,\r","'t was like the fawn, which, in the lake display'd,\r","beholds her own shy, shadowy image pass,\r","when first she starts, and then returns to peep,\r","admiring this new native of the deep\r","and one by one her articles of dress\r","were laid aside; but not before she offer'd\r","her aid to fair juanna, whose excess\r","of modesty declined the assistance proffer'd:\r","which pass'd well off- as she could do no less;\r","though by this politesse she rather suffer'd,\r","pricking her fingers with those cursed pins,\r","which surely were invented for our sins,-\r","making a woman like a porcupine,\r","not to be rashly touch'd but still more dread,\r","oh ye! whose fate it is, as once 't was mine,\r","in early youth, to turn a lady's maid;-\r","i did my very boyish best to shine\r","in tricking her out for a masquerade;\r","the pins were placed sufficiently, but not\r","stuck all exactly in the proper spot\r","but these are foolish things to all the wise,\r","and i love wisdom more than she loves me;\r","my tendency is to philosophise\r","on most things, from a tyrant to a tree;\r","but still the spouseless virgin knowledge flies\r","what are we? and whence came we? what shall be\r","our ultimate existence? what 's our present?\r","are questions answerless, and yet incessant\r","there was deep silence in the chamber: dim\r","and distant from each other burn'd the lights,\r","and slumber hover'd o'er each lovely limb\r","of the fair occupants: if there be sprites,\r","they should have walk'd there in their sprightliest trim,\r","by way of change from their sepulchral sites,\r","and shown themsees as ghosts of better taste\r","than haunting some old ruin or wild waste\r","many and beautiful lay those around,\r","like flowers of different hue, and dime, and root,\r","in some exotic garden sometimes found,\r","with cost, and care, and warmth induced to shoot\r","one with her auburn tresses lightly bound,\r","and fair brows gently drooping, as the fruit\r","nods from the tree, was slumbering with soft breath,\r","and lips apart, which show'd the pearls beneath\r","one with her flush'd cheek laid on her white arm,\r","     \r","and raven ringlets gather'd in dark crowd\r","above her brow, lay dreaming soft and warm;\r","and smiling through her dream, as through a cloud\r","the moon breaks, half unveil'd each further charm,\r","as, slightly stirring in her snowy shroud,\r","her beauties seized the unconscious hour of night\r","all bashfully to struggle into light\r","this is no bull, although it sounds so; for\r","'t was night, but there were lamps, as hath been said\r","a third's all pallid aspect offer'd more\r","the traits of sleeping sorrow, and betray'd\r","through the heaved breast the dream of some far shore\r","beloved and deplored; while slowly stray'd\r","as night-dew, on a cypress glittering, tinges\r","the black bough tear-drops through her eyes' dark fringes\r","a fourth as marble, statue-like and still,\r","lay in a breathless, hush'd, and stony sleep;\r","white, cold, and pure, as looks a frozen rill,\r","or the snow minaret on an alpine steep,\r","or lot's wife done in salt,- or what you will;-\r","my similes are gather'd in a heap,\r","so pick and choose- perhaps you 'll be content\r","with a carved lady on a monument\r","and lo! a fifth appears;- and what is she?\r","a lady of a 'certain age,' which means\r","certainly aged- what her years might be\r","i know not, never counting past their teens;\r","but there she slept, not quite so fair to see,\r","as ere that awful period intervenes\r","which lays both men and women on the shelf,\r","to meditate upon their sins and self\r","but all this time how slept, or dream'd, dudu?\r","with strict inquiry i could ne'er discover,\r","and scorn to add a syllable untrue;\r","but ere the middle watch was hardly over,\r","just when the fading lamps waned dim and blue,\r","and phantoms hover'd, or might seem to hover,\r","to those who like their company, about\r","       \r","the apartment, on a sudden she scream'd out:\r","and that so loudly, that upstarted all\r","the oda, in a general commotion:\r","matron and maids, and those whom you may call\r","neither, came crowding like the waves of ocean,\r","one on the other, throughout the whole hall,\r","all trembling, wondering, without the least notion\r","more than i have myself of what could make\r","the calm dudu so turbulently wake\r","but wide awake she was, and round her bed,\r","with floating draperies and with flying hair,\r","with eager eyes, and light but hurried tread,\r","and bosoms, arms, and ankles glancing bare,\r","and bright as any meteor ever bred\r","by the north pole,- they sought her cause of care,\r","for she seem'd agitated, flush'd, and frighten'd,\r","her eye dilated and her colour heighten'd\r","but what was strange- and a strong proof how great\r","a blessing is sound sleep- juanna lay\r","as fast as ever husband by his mate\r","in holy matrimony snores away\r","not all the clamour broke her happy state\r","of slumber, ere they shook her,- so they say\r","at least,- and then she, too, unclosed her eyes,\r","and yawn'd a good deal with discreet surprise\r","and now commenced a strict investigation,\r","which, as all spoke at once and more than once,\r","conjecturing, wondering, asking a narration,\r","alike might puzzle either wit or dunce\r","to answer in a very clear oration\r","dudu had never pass'd for wanting sense,\r","but, being 'no orator as brutus is,'\r","could not at first expound what was amiss\r","at length she said, that in a slumber sound\r","she dream'd a dream, of walking in a wood-\r","a 'wood obscure,' like that where dante found\r","himself in at the age when all grow good;\r","     \r","life's half-way house, where dames with virtue crown'd\r","run much less risk of lovers turning rude;\r","and that this wood was full of pleasant fruits,\r","and trees of goodly growth and spreading roots;\r","and in the midst a golden apple grew,-\r","a most prodigious pippin,- but it hung\r","rather too high and distant; that she threw\r","her glances on it, and then, longing, flung\r","stones and whatever she could pick up, to\r","bring down the fruit, which still perversely clung\r","to its own bough, and dangled yet in sight,\r","but always at a most provoking height;-\r","that on a sudden, when she least had hope,\r","it fell down of its own accord before\r","her feet; that her first movement was to stoop\r","and pick it up, and bite it to the core;\r","that just as her young lip began to ope\r","upon the golden fruit the vision bore,\r","a bee flew out and stung her to the heart,\r","and so- she awoke with a great scream and start\r","all this she told with some confusion and\r","dismay, the usual consequence of dreams\r","of the unpleasant kind, with none at hand\r","to expound their vain and visionary gleams\r","i 've known some odd ones which seem'd really plann'd\r","prophetically, or that which one deems\r","a 'strange coincidence,' to use a phrase\r","by which such things are settled now-a-days\r","the damsels, who had thoughts of some great harm,\r","began, as is the consequence of fear,\r","to scold a little at the false alarm\r","that broke for nothing on their sleeping car\r","the matron, too, was wroth to leave her warm\r","bed for the dream she had been obliged to hear,\r","and chafed at poor dudu, who only sigh'd,\r","and said that she was sorry she had cried\r","'i 've heard of stories of a cock and bull;\r","  \r","but visions of an apple and a bee,\r","to take us from our natural rest, and pull\r","the whole oda from their beds at half-past three,\r","would make us think the moon is at its full\r","you surely are unwell, child! we must see,\r","to-morrow, what his highness's physician\r","will say to this hysteric of a vision\r","'and poor juanna, too- the child's first night\r","within these walls to be broke in upon\r","with such a clamour! i had thought it right\r","that the young stranger should not lie alone,\r","and, as the quietest of all, she might\r","with you, dudu, a good night's rest have known;\r","but now i must transfer her to the charge\r","of lolah- though her couch is not so large'\r","lolah's eyes sparkled at the proposition;\r","but poor dudu, with large drops in her own,\r","resulting from the scolding or the vision,\r","implored that present pardon might be shown\r","for this first fault, and that on no condition\r","she added in a soft and piteous tone\r","juanna should be taken from her, and\r","her future dreams should all be kept in hand\r","she promised never more to have a dream,\r","at least to dream so loudly as just now;\r","she wonder'd at herself how she could scream-\r","'t was foolish, nervous, as she must allow,\r","a fond hallucination, and a theme\r","for laughter- but she felt her spirits low,\r","and begg'd they would excuse her; she 'd get over\r","this weakness in a few hours, and recover\r","and here juanna kindly interposed,\r","and said she felt herself extremely well\r","where she then was, as her sound sleep disclosed\r","when all around rang like a tocsin bell:\r","she did not find herself the least disposed\r","to quit her gentle partner, and to dwell\r","apart from one who had no sin to show,\r","    \r","save that of dreaming once 'mal-a-propos'\r","as thus juanna spoke, dudu turn'd round\r","and hid her face within juanna's breast:\r","her neck alone was seen, but that was found\r","the colour of a budding rose's crest\r","i can't tell why she blush'd, nor can expound\r","the mystery of this rupture of their rest;\r","all that i know is, that the facts i state\r","are true as truth has ever been of late\r","and so good night to them,- or, if you will,\r","good morrow- for the cock had crown, and light\r","began to clothe each asiatic hill,\r","and the mosque crescent struggled into sight\r","of the long caravan, which in the chill\r","of dewy dawn wound slowly round each height\r","that stretches to the stony belt, which girds\r","asia, where kaff looks down upon the kurds\r","with the first ray, or rather grey of morn,\r","gulbeyaz rose from restlessness; and pale\r","as passion rises, with its bosom worn,\r","array'd herself with mantle, gem, and veil\r","the nightingale that sings with the deep thorn,\r","which fable places in her breast of wail,\r","is lighter far of heart and voice than those\r","whose headlong passions form their proper woes\r","and that 's the moral of this composition,\r","if people would but see its real drift;-\r","but that they will not do without suspicion,\r","because all gentle readers have the gift\r","of closing 'gainst the light their orbs of vision;\r","while gentle writers also love to lift\r","their voices 'gainst each other, which is natural,\r","the numbers are too great for them to flatter all\r","rose the sultana from a bed of splendour,\r","softer than the soft sybarite's, who cried\r","aloud because his feelings were too tender\r","to brook a ruffled rose-leaf by his side,-\r","     \r","so beautiful that art could little mend her,\r","though pale with conflicts between love and pride;-\r","so agitated was she with her error,\r","she did not even look into the mirror\r","also arose about the self-same time,\r","perhaps a little later, her great lord,\r","master of thirty kingdoms so sublime,\r","and of a wife by whom he was abhorr'd;\r","a thing of much less import in that clime-\r","at least to those of incomes which afford\r","the filling up their whole connubial cargo-\r","than where two wives are under an embargo\r","he did not think much on the matter, nor\r","indeed on any other: as a man\r","he liked to have a handsome paramour\r","at hand, as one may like to have a fan,\r","and therefore of circassians had good store,\r","as an amusement after the divan;\r","though an unusual fit of love, or duty,\r","had made him lately bask in his bride's beauty\r","and now he rose; and after due ablutions\r","exacted by the customs of the east,\r","and prayers and other pious evolutions,\r","he drank six cups of coffee at the least,\r","and then withdrew to hear about the russians,\r","whose victories had recently increased\r","in catherine's reign, whom glory still adores,\r","but oh, thou grand legitimate alexander!\r","her son's son, let not this last phrase offend\r","thine ear, if it should reach- and now rhymes wander\r","almost as far as petersburgh and lend\r","a dreadful impulse to each loud meander\r","of murmuring liberty's wide waves, which blend\r","their roar even with the baltic's- so you be\r","your father's son, 't is quite enough for me\r","to call men love-begotten or proclaim\r","their mothers as the antipodes of timon,\r","that hater of mankind, would be a shame,\r","a libel, or whate'er you please to rhyme on:\r","but people's ancestors are history's game;\r","and if one lady's slip could leave a crime on\r","all generations, i should like to know\r","what pedigree the best would have to show?\r","had catherine and the sultan understood\r","their own true interests, which kings rarely know\r","until 't is taught by lessons rather rude,\r","there was a way to end their strife, although\r","perhaps precarious, had they but thought good,\r","without the aid of prince or plenipo:\r","she to dismiss her guards and he his haram,\r","and for their other matters, meet and share 'em\r","but as it was, his highness had to hold\r","his daily council upon ways and means\r","how to encounter with this martial scold,\r","this modern amazon and queen of queans;\r","and the perplexity could not be told\r","of all the pillars of the state, which leans\r","sometimes a little heavy on the backs\r","of those who cannot lay on a new ta\r","meantime gulbeyaz, when her king was gone,\r","retired into her boudoir, a sweet place\r","for love or breakfast; private, pleasing, lone,\r","and rich with all contrivances which grace\r","those gay recesses:- many a precious stone\r","sparkled along its roof, and many a vase\r","of porcelain held in the fetter'd flowers,\r","those captive soothers of a captive's hours\r","mother of pearl, and porphyry, and marble,\r","vied with each other on this costly spot;\r","and singing birds without were heard to warble;\r","and the stain'd glass which lighted this fair grot\r","varied each ray;- but all descriptions garble\r","the true effect, and so we had better not\r","be too minute; an outline is the best,-\r","a lively reader's fancy does the rest\r","     \r","and here she summon'd baba, and required\r","don juan at his hands, and information\r","of what had pass'd since all the slaves retired,\r","and whether he had occupied their station;\r","if matters had been managed as desired,\r","and his disguise with due consideration\r","kept up; and above all, the where and how\r","he had pass'd the night, was what she wish'd to know\r","baba, with some embarrassment, replied\r","to this long catechism of questions, ask'd\r","more easily than answer'd,- that he had tried\r","his best to obey in what he had been task'd;\r","but there seem'd something that he wish'd to hide,\r","which hesitation more betray'd than mask'd;\r","he scratch'd his ear, the infallible resource\r","to which embarrass'd people have recourse\r","gulbeyaz was no model of true patience,\r","nor much disposed to wait in word or deed;\r","she liked quick answers in all conversations;\r","and when she saw him stumbling like a steed\r","in his replies, she puzzled him for fresh ones;\r","and as his speech grew still more broken-kneed,\r","her cheek began to flush, her eyes to sparkle,\r","and her proud brow's blue veins to swell and darkle\r","when baba saw these symptoms, which he knew\r","to bode him no great good, he deprecated\r","her anger, and beseech'd she 'd hear him through-\r","he could not help the thing which he related:\r","then out it came at length, that to dudu\r","juan was given in charge, as hath been stated;\r","but not by baba's fault, he said, and swore on\r","the holy camel's hump, besides the koran\r","the chief dame of the oda, upon whom\r","the discipline of the whole haram bore,\r","as soon as they re-enter'd their own room,\r","for baba's function stopt short at the door,\r","had settled all; nor could he then presume\r"," \r","the aforesaid baba just then to do more,\r","without eting such suspicion as\r","might make the matter still worse than it was\r","he hoped, indeed he thought, he could be sure\r","juan had not betray'd himself; in fact\r","'t was certain that his conduct had been pure,\r","because a foolish or imprudent act\r","would not alone have made him insecure,\r","but ended in his being found out and sack'd,\r","and thrown into the sea- thus baba spoke\r","of all save dudu's dream, which was no joke\r","this he discreetly kept in the background,\r","and talk'd away- and might have talk'd till now,\r","for any further answer that he found,\r","so deep an anguish wrung gulbeyaz' brow:\r","her cheek turn'd ashes, ears rung, brain whirl'd round,\r","as if she had received a sudden blow,\r","and the heart's dew of pain sprang fast and chilly\r","o'er her fair front, like morning's on a lily\r","although she was not of the fainting sort,\r","baba thought she would faint, but there he err'd-\r","it was but a convulsion, which though short\r","can never be described; we all have heard,\r","and some of us have felt thus 'all amort,'\r","when things beyond the common have occurr'd;-\r","gulbeyaz proved in that brief agony\r","what she could ne'er express- then how should i?\r","she stood a moment as a pythones\r","stands on her tripod, agonised, and full\r","of inspiration gather'd from distress,\r","when all the heart-strings like wild horses pull\r","the heart asunder;- then, as more or lees\r","their speed abated or their strength grew dull,\r","she sunk down on her seat by slow degrees,\r","and bow'd her throbbing head o'er trembling knees\r","her face declined and was unseen; her hair\r","fell in long tresses like the weeping willow,\r","   \r","sweeping the marble underneath her chair,\r","or rather sofa for it was all pillow,\r","a low soft ottoman, and black despair\r","stirr'd up and down her bosom like a billow,\r","which rushes to some shore whose shingles check\r","its farther course, but must receive its wreck\r","her head hung down, and her long hair in stooping\r","conceal'd her features better than a veil;\r","and one hand o'er the ottoman lay drooping,\r","white, waxen, and as alabaster pale:\r","would that i were a painter! to be grouping\r","all that a poet drags into detail\r","oh that my words were colours! but their tints\r","may serve perhaps as outlines or slight hints\r","baba, who knew by experience when to talk\r","and when to hold his tongue, now held it till\r","this passion might blow o'er, nor dared to balk\r","gulbeyaz' taciturn or speaking will\r","at length she rose up, and began to walk\r","slowly along the room, but silent still,\r","and her brow clear'd, but not her troubled eye;\r","the wind was down, but still the sea ran high\r","she stopp'd, and raised her head to speak- but paused,\r","and then moved on again with rapid pace;\r","then slacken'd it, which is the march most caused\r","by deep emotion:- you may sometimes trace\r","a feeling in each footstep, as disclosed\r","by sallust in his catiline, who, chased\r","by all the demons of all passions, show'd\r","their work even by the way in which he trode\r","gulbeyaz stopp'd and beckon'd baba:- 'slave!\r","bring the two slaves!' she said in a low tone,\r","but one which baba did not like to brave,\r","and yet he shudder'd, and seem'd rather prone\r","to prove reluctant, and begg'd leave to crave\r","though he well knew the meaning to be shown\r","what slaves her highness wish'd to indicate,\r","for fear of any error, like the late\r","  \r","'the georgian and her paramour,' replied\r","the imperial bride- and added, 'let the boat\r","be ready by the secret portal's side:\r","you know the rest' the words stuck in her throat,\r","despite her injured love and fiery pride;\r","and of this baba willingly took note,\r","and begg'd by every hair of mahomet's beard,\r","she would revoke the order he had heard\r","'to hear is to obey,' he said; 'but still,\r","sultana, think upon the consequence:\r","it is not that i shall not all fulfil\r","your orders, even in their severest sense;\r","but such precipitation may end ill,\r","even at your own imperative expense:\r","i do not mean destruction and exposure,\r","in case of any premature disclosure;\r","'but your own feelings even should all the rest\r","be hidden by the rolling waves, which hide\r","already many a once love-beaten breast\r","deep in the caverns of the deadly tide-\r","you love this boyish, new, seraglio guest,\r","and if this violent remedy be tried-\r","excuse my freedom, when i here assure you,\r","that killing him is not the way to cure you'\r","'what dost thou know of love or feeling?- wretch!\r","begone!' she cried, with kindling eyes- 'and do\r","my bidding!' baba vanish'd, for to stretch\r","his own remonstrance further he well knew\r","might end in acting as his own 'jack ketch;'\r","and though he wish'd extremely to get through\r","this awkward business without harm to others,\r","he still preferr'd his own neck to another's\r","away he went then upon his commission,\r","growling and grumbling in good turkish phrase\r","against all women of whate'er condition,\r","especially sultanas and their ways;\r","their obstinacy, pride, and indecision,\r","     \r","their never knowing their own mind two days,\r","the trouble that they gave, their immorality,\r","which made him daily bless his own neutrality\r","and then he call'd his brethren to his aid,\r","and sent one on a summons to the pair,\r","that they must instantly be well array'd,\r","and above all be comb'd even to a hair,\r","and brought before the empress, who had made\r","inquiries after them with kindest care:\r","at which dudu look'd strange, and juan silly;\r","but go they must at once, and will i- nill i\r","and here i leave them at their preparation\r","for the imperial presence, wherein whether\r","gulbeyaz show'd them both commiseration,\r","or got rid of the parties altogether,\r","like other angry ladies of her nation,-\r","are things the turning of a hair or feather\r","may settle; but far be 't from me to anticipate\r","in what way feminine caprice may dissipate\r","i leave them for the present with good wishes,\r","though doubts of their well doing, to arrange\r","another part of history; for the dishes\r","of this our banquet we must sometimes change;\r","and trusting juan may escape the fishes,\r","although his situation now seems strange\r","and scarce secure, as such digressions are fair,\r","the muse will take a little touch at warfare\r","   \r","don juan: canto the tenth\r","when newton saw an apple fall, he found\r","in that slight startle from his contemplation--\r","'tis said for i 'll not answer above ground\r","for any sage's creed or calculation--\r","a mode of proving that the earth turn'd round\r","in a most natural whirl, called 'gravitation;'\r","and this is the sole mortal who could grapple,\r","since adam, with a fall or with an apple\r","man fell with apples, and with apples rose,\r","if this be true; for we must deem the mode\r","in which sir isaac newton could disclose\r","through the then unpaved stars the turnpike road,\r","a thing to counterbalance human woes:\r","for ever since immortal man hath glow'd\r","with all kinds of mechanics, and full soon\r","steam-engines will conduct him to the moon\r","and wherefore this exordium?--why, just now,\r","in taking up this paltry sheet of paper,\r","my bosom underwent a glorious glow,\r","and my internal spirit cut a caper:\r","and though so much inferior, as i know,\r","to those who, by the dint of glass and vapour,\r","discover stars and sail in the wind's eye,\r","i wish to do as much by poesy\r","in the wind's eye i have sail'd, and sail; but for\r","the stars, i own my telescope is dim:\r","but at least i have shunn'd the common shore,\r","and leaving land far out of sight, would skim\r","the ocean of eternity: the roar\r","of breakers has not daunted my slight, trim,\r","but still sea-worthy skiff; and she may float\r","where ships have founder'd, as doth many a boat\r","we left our hero, juan, in the bloom\r","of favouritism, but not yet in the blush;\r","and far be it from my muses to presume\r","     \r","for i have more than one muse at a push\r","to follow him beyond the drawing-room:\r","it is enough that fortune found him flush\r","of youth, and vigour, beauty, and those things\r","which for an instant clip enjoyment's wings\r","but soon they grow again and leave their nest\r","'oh!' saith the psalmist, 'that i had a dove's\r","pinions to flee away, and be at rest!'\r","and who that recollects young years and loves,--\r","though hoary now, and with a withering breast,\r","and palsied fancy, which no longer roves\r","beyond its dimm'd eye's sphere,--but would much rather\r","sigh like his son, than cough like his grandfather?\r","but sighs subside, and tears even widows' shrink,\r","like arno in the summer, to a shallow,\r","so narrow as to shame their wintry brink,\r","which threatens inundations deep and yellow!\r","such difference doth a few months make you 'd think\r","grief a rich field which never would lie fallow;\r","no more it doth, its ploughs but change their boys,\r","who furrow some new soil to sow for joys\r","but coughs will come when sighs depart--and now\r","and then before sighs cease; for oft the one\r","will bring the other, ere the lake-like brow\r","is ruffled by a wrinkle, or the sun\r","of life reach'd ten o'clock: and while a glow,\r","hectic and brief as summer's day nigh done,\r","o'erspreads the cheek which seems too pure for clay,\r","thousands blaze, love, hope, die,--how happy they!\r","but juan was not meant to die so soon\r","we left him in the focus of such glory\r","as may be won by favour of the moon\r","or ladies' fancies--rather transitory\r","perhaps; but who would scorn the month of june,\r","because december, with his breath so hoary,\r","must come? much rather should he court the ray,\r","to hoard up warmth against a wintry day\r","  \r","besides, he had some qualities which fi\r","middle-aged ladies even more than young:\r","the former know what's what; while new-fledged chicks\r","know little more of love than what is sung\r","in rhymes, or dreamt for fancy will play tricks\r","in visions of those skies from whence love sprung\r","some reckon women by their suns or years,\r","i rather think the moon should date the dears\r","and why? because she's changeable and chaste\r","i know no other reason, whatsoe'er\r","suspicious people, who find fault in haste,\r","may choose to tax me with; which is not fair,\r","nor flattering to 'their temper or their taste,'\r","as my friend jeffrey writes with such an air:\r","however, i forgive him, and i trust\r","he will forgive himself;--if not, i must\r","old enemies who have become new friends\r","should so continue--'tis a point of honour;\r","and i know nothing which could make amends\r","for a return to hatred: i would shun her\r","like garlic, howsoever she extends\r","her hundred arms and legs, and fain outrun her\r","old flames, new wives, become our bitterest foes--\r","converted foes should scorn to join with those\r","this were the worst desertion:- renegadoes,\r","even shuffling southey, that incarnate lie,\r","would scarcely join again the 'reformadoes,'\r","whom he forsook to fill the laureate's sty:\r","and honest men from iceland to barbadoes,\r","whether in caledon or italy,\r","should not veer round with every breath, nor seize\r","to pain, the moment when you cease to please\r","the lawyer and the critic but behold\r","the baser sides of literature and life,\r","and nought remains unseen, but much untold,\r","by those who scour those double vales of strife\r","while common men grow ignorantly old,\r","the lawyer's brief is like the surgeon's knife,\r"," \r","dissecting the whole inside of a question,\r","and with it all the process of digestion\r","a legal broom's a moral chimney-sweeper,\r","and that's the reason he himself's so dirty;\r","the endless soot bestows a tint far deeper\r","than can be hid by altering his shirt; he\r","retains the sable stains of the dark creeper,\r","at least some twenty-nine do out of thirty,\r","in all their habits;--not so you, i own;\r","as caesar wore his robe you wear your gown\r","and all our little feuds, at least all mine,\r","dear jefferson, once my most redoubted foe\r","as far as rhyme and criticism combine\r","to make such puppets of us things below,\r","are over: here's a health to 'auld lang syne!'\r","i do not know you, and may never know\r","your face--but you have acted on the whole\r","most nobly, and i own it from my soul\r","and when i use the phrase of 'auld lang syne!'\r","'tis not address'd to you--the more 's the pity\r","for me, for i would rather take my wine\r","with you, than aught save scott in your proud city\r","but somehow,--it may seem a schoolboy's whine,\r","and yet i seek not to be grand nor witty,\r","but i am half a scot by birth, and bred\r","a whole one, and my heart flies to my head,--\r","as 'auld lang syne' brings scotland, one and all,\r","scotch plaids, scotch snoods, the blue hills, and clear streams,\r","the dee, the don, balgounie's brig's black wall,\r","all my boy feelings, all my gentler dreams\r","of what i then dreamt, clothed in their own pall,\r","like banquo's offspring;--floating past me seems\r","my childhood in this childishness of mine:\r","i care not--'tis a glimpse of 'auld lang syne'\r","and though, as you remember, in a fit\r","of wrath and rhyme, when juvenile and curly,\r","i rail'd at scots to show my wrath and wit,\r","            \r","which must be own'd was sensitive and surly,\r","yet 't is in vain such sallies to permit,\r","they cannot quench young feelings fresh and early:\r","i 'scotch'd not kill'd' the scotchman in my blood,\r","and love the land of 'mountain and of flood'\r","don juan, who was real, or ideal,--\r","for both are much the same, since what men think\r","exists when the once thinkers are less real\r","than what they thought, for mind can never sink,\r","and 'gainst the body makes a strong appeal;\r","and yet 'tis very puzzling on the brink\r","of what is call'd eternity, to stare,\r","and know no more of what is here, than there;--\r","don juan grew a very polish'd russian--\r","how we won't mention, why we need not say:\r","few youthful minds can stand the strong concussion\r","of any slight temptation in their way;\r","but his just now were spread as is a cushion\r","smooth'd for a monarch's seat of honour; gay\r","damsels, and dances, revels, ready money,\r","made ice seem paradise, and winter sunny\r","the favour of the empress was agreeable;\r","and though the duty wax'd a little hard,\r","young people at his time of life should be able\r","to come off handsomely in that regard\r","he was now growing up like a green tree, able\r","for love, war, or ambition, which reward\r","their luckier votaries, till old age's tedium\r","make some prefer the circulating medium\r","about this time, as might have been anticipated,\r","seduced by youth and dangerous examples,\r","don juan grew, i fear, a little dissipated;\r","which is a sad thing, and not only tramples\r","on our fresh feelings, but- as being participated\r","with all kinds of incorrigible samples\r","of frail humanity--must make us selfish,\r","and shut our souls up in us like a shell-fish\r","     \r","this we pass over we will also pass\r","the usual progress of intrigues between\r","unequal matches, such as are, alas!\r","a young lieutenant's with a not old queen,\r","but one who is not so youthful as she was\r","in all the royalty of sweet seventeen\r","sovereigns may sway materials, but not matter,\r","and death, the sovereign's sovereign, though the great\r","gracchus of all mortality, who levels\r","with his agrarian laws the high estate\r","of him who feasts, and fights, and roars, and revels,\r","to one small grass-grown patch which must await\r","corruption for its crop with the poor devils\r","who never had a foot of land till now,--\r","death's a reformer, all men must allow\r","he lived not death, but juan in a hurry\r","of waste, and haste, and glare, and gloss, and glitter,\r","in this gay clime of bear-skins black and furry-\r","which though i hate to say a thing that 's bitter\r","peep out sometimes, when things are in a flurry,\r","through all the 'purple and fine linen,' fitter\r","for babylon's than russia's royal harlot--\r","and neutralize her outward show of scarlet\r","and this same state we won't describe: we would\r","perhaps from hearsay, or from recollection;\r","but getting nigh grim dante's 'obscure wood,'\r","that horrid equinox, that hateful section\r","of human years, that half-way house, that rude\r","hut, whence wise travellers drive with circumspection\r","life's sad post-horses o'er the dreary frontier\r","of age, and looking back to youth, give one tear;--\r","i won't describe,--that is, if i can help\r","description; and i won't reflect,--that is,\r","if i can stave off thought, which--as a whelp\r","clings to its teat--sticks to me through the abyss\r","of this odd labyrinth; or as the kelp\r","holds by the rock; or as a lover's kiss\r","drains its first draught of lips:--but, as i said,\r","   \r","i won't philosophise, and will be read\r","juan, instead of courting courts, was courted,--\r","a thing which happens rarely: this he owed\r","much to his youth, and much to his reported\r","valour; much also to the blood he show'd,\r","like a race-horse; much to each dress he sported,\r","which set the beauty off in which he glow'd,\r","as purple clouds befringe the sun; but most\r","he owed to an old woman and his post\r","he wrote to spain:--and all his near relations,\r","perceiving fie was in a handsome way\r","of getting on himself, and finding stations\r","for cousins also, answer'd the same day\r","several prepared themsees for emigrations;\r","and eating ices, were o'erheard to say,\r","that with the addition of a slight pelisse,\r","madrid's and moscow's climes were of a piece\r","his mother, donna inez, finding, too,\r","that in the lieu of drawing on his banker,\r","where his assets were waxing rather few,\r","he had brought his spending to a handsome anchor,--\r","replied, 'that she was glad to see him through\r","those pleasures after which wild youth will hanker;\r","as the sole sign of man's being in his senses\r","is, learning to reduce his past expenses\r","'she also recommended him to god,\r","and no less to god's son, as well as mother,\r","warn'd him against greek worship, which looks odd\r","in catholic eyes; but told him, too, to smother\r","outward dislike, which don't look well abroad;\r","inform'd him that he had a little brother\r","born in a second wedlock; and above\r","all, praised the empress's maternal love\r","'she could not too much give her approbation\r","unto an empress, who preferr'd young men\r","whose age, and what was better still, whose nation\r","and climate, stopp'd all scandal now and then:--\r","at home it might have given her some vexation;\r","but where thermometers sunk down to ten,\r","or five, or one, or zero, she could never\r","believe that virtue thaw'd before the river'\r","oh for a forty-parson power to chant\r","thy praise, hypocrisy! oh for a hymn\r","loud as the virtues thou dost loudly vaunt,\r","not practise! oh for trumps of cherubim!\r","or the ear-trumpet of my good old aunt,\r","who, though her spectacles at last grew dim,\r","drew quiet consolation through its hint,\r","when she no more could read the pious print\r","she was no hypocrite at least, poor soul,\r","but went to heaven in as sincere a way\r","as any body on the elected roll,\r","which portions out upon the judgment day\r","heaven's freeholds, in a sort of doomsday scroll,\r","such as the conqueror william did repay\r","his knights with, lotting others' properties\r","into some sixty thousand new knights' fees\r","i can't complain, whose ancestors are there,\r","erneis, radulphus--eight-and-forty manors\r","if that my memory doth not greatly err\r","were their reward for following billy's banners:\r","and though i can't help thinking 'twas scarce fair\r","to strip the saxons of their hydes, like tanners;\r","yet as they founded churches with the produce,\r","you'll deem, no doubt, they put it to a good use\r","the gentle juan flourish'd, though at times\r","he felt like other plants called sensitive,\r","which shrink from touch, as monarchs do from rhymes,\r","save such as southey can afford to give\r","perhaps he long'd in bitter frosts for climes\r","in which the neva's ice would cease to live\r","before may-day: perhaps, despite his duty,\r","in royalty's vast arms he sigh d for beauty:\r","perhaps--but, sans perhaps, we need not seek\r","for causes young or old: the canker-worm\r","will feed upon the fairest, freshest cheek,\r","as well as further drain the wither'd form:\r","care, like a housekeeper, brings every week\r","his bills in, and however we may storm,\r","they must be paid: though six days smoothly run,\r","the seventh will bring blue devils or a dun\r","i don't know how it was, but he grew sick:\r","the empress was alarm'd, and her physician\r","the same who physick'd peter found the tick\r","of his fierce pulse betoken a condition\r","which augur'd of the dead, however quick\r","itself, and show'd a feverish disposition;\r","at which the whole court was extremely troubled,\r","the sovereign shock'd, and all his medicines doubled\r","low were the whispers, manifold the rumours:\r","some said he had been poison'd by potemkin;\r","others talk'd learnedly of certain tumours,\r","exhaustion, or disorders of the same kin;\r","some said 'twas a concoction of the humours,\r","which with the blood too readily will claim kin;\r","others again were ready to maintain,\r","''twas only the fatigue of last campaign'\r","but here is one prescription out of many:\r","'sodae sulphat vj fs mannae optim\r","aq fervent f ifs ij tinct sennae\r","haustus' and here the surgeon came and cupp'd him\r","'rx pu com gr iij ipecacuanhae'\r","with more beside if juan had not stopp'd 'em\r","'bolus potassae sulphuret sumendus,\r","et haustus ter in die capiendus'\r","this is the way physicians mend or end us,\r","secundum artem: but although we sneer\r","in health--when ill, we call them to attend us,\r","without the least propensity to jeer:\r","while that 'hiatus maxime deflendus'\r","to be fill'd up by spade or mattock's near,\r","instead of gliding graciously down lethe,\r"," \r","we tease mild baillie, or soft abernethy\r","juan demurr'd at this first notice to\r","quit; and though death had threaten'd an ejection,\r","his youth and constitution bore him through,\r","and sent the doctors in a new direction\r","but still his state was delicate: the hue\r","of health but flicker'd with a faint reflection\r","along his wasted cheek, and seem'd to gravel\r","the faculty--who said that he must travel\r","the climate was too cold, they said, for him,\r","meridian-born, to bloom in this opinion\r","made the chaste catherine look a little grim,\r","who did not like at first to lose her minion:\r","but when she saw his dazzling eye wax dim,\r","and drooping like an eagle's with clipt pinion,\r","she then resoed to send him on a mission,\r","but in a style becoming his condition\r","there was just then a kind of a discussion,\r","a sort of treaty or negotiation\r","between the british cabinet and russian,\r","maintain'd with all the due prevarication\r","with which great states such things are apt to push on;\r","something about the baltic's navigation,\r","hides, train-oil, tallow, and the rights of thetis,\r","which britons deem their 'uti possidetis'\r","so catherine, who had a handsome way\r","of fitting out her favourites, conferr'd\r","this secret charge on juan, to display\r","at once her royal splendour, and reward\r","his services he kiss'd hands the next day,\r","received instructions how to play his card,\r","was laden with all kinds of gifts and honours,\r","which show'd what great discernment was the donor's\r","but she was lucky, and luck 's all your queens\r","are generally prosperous in reigning;\r","which puzzles us to know what fortune means\r","but to continue: though her years were waning\r","   \r","her climacteric teased her like her teens;\r","and though her dignity brook'd no complaining,\r","so much did juan's setting off distress her,\r","she could not find at first a fit successor\r","but time, the comforter, will come at last;\r","and four-and-twenty hours, and twice that number\r","of candidates requesting to be placed,\r","made catherine taste next night a quiet slumber:--\r","not that she meant to fix again in haste,\r","nor did she find the quantity encumber,\r","but always choosing with deliberation,\r","kept the place open for their emulation\r","while this high post of honour's in abeyance,\r","for one or two days, reader, we request\r","you'll mount with our young hero the conveyance\r","which wafted him from petersburgh: the best\r","barouche, which had the glory to display once\r","the fair czarina's autocratic crest,\r","when, a new lphigene, she went to tauris,\r","was given to her favourite, and now bore his\r","a bull-dog, and a bullfinch, and an ermine,\r","all private favourites of don juan;--for\r","let deeper sages the true cause determine\r","he had a kind of inclination, or\r","weakness, for what most people deem mere vermin,\r","live animals: an old maid of threescore\r","for cats and birds more penchant ne'er display'd,\r","although he was not old, nor even a maid;--\r","the animals aforesaid occupied\r","their station: there were valets, secretaries,\r","in other vehicles; but at his side\r","sat little leila, who survived the parries\r","he made 'gainst cossacque sabres, in the wide\r","slaughter of ismail though my wild muse varies\r","her note, she don't forget the infant girl\r","whom he preserved, a pure and living pearl\r","poor little thing! she was as fair as docile,\r","     \r","and with that gentle, serious character,\r","as rare in living beings as a fossile\r","man, 'midst thy mouldy mammoths, 'grand cuvier!'\r","ill fitted was her ignorance to jostle\r","with this o'erwhelming world, where all must err:\r","but she was yet but ten years old, and therefore\r","was tranquil, though she knew not why or wherefore\r","don juan loved her, and she loved him, as\r","nor brother, father, sister, daughter love\r","i cannot tell exactly what it was;\r","he was not yet quite old enough to prove\r","parental feelings, and the other class,\r","call'd brotherly affection, could not move\r","his bosom,--for he never had a sister:\r","ah! if he had, how much he would have miss'd her!\r","and still less was it sensual; for besides\r","that he was not an ancient debauchee\r","who like sour fruit, to stir their veins' salt tides,\r","as acids rouse a dormant alkali,\r","although 'twill happen as our planet guides\r","his youth was not the chastest that might be,\r","there was the purest platonism at bottom\r","of all his feelings--only he forgot 'em\r","just now there was no peril of temptation;\r","he loved the infant orphan he had saved,\r","as patriots now and then may love a nation;\r","his pride, too, felt that she was not enslaved\r","owing to him;--as also her saation\r","through his means and the church's might be paved\r","but one thing's odd, which here must be inserted,\r","the little turk refused to be converted\r","'twas strange enough she should retain the impression\r","through such a scene of change, and dread, and slaughter;\r","but though three bishops told her the transgression,\r","she show'd a great dislike to holy water:\r","she also had no passion for confession;\r","perhaps she had nothing to confess:--no matter,\r","whate'er the cause, the church made little of it--\r","     \r","she still held out that mahomet was a prophet\r","in fact, the only christian she could bear\r","was juan; whom she seem'd to have selected\r","in place of what her home and friends once were\r","he naturally loved what he protected:\r","and thus they form'd a rather curious pair,\r","a guardian green in years, a ward connected\r","in neither clime, time, blood, with her defender;\r","and yet this want of ties made theirs more tender\r","they journey'd on through poland and through warsaw,\r","famous for mines of salt and yokes of iron:\r","through courland also, which that famous farce saw\r","which gave her dukes the graceless name of 'biron'\r","'tis the same landscape which the modern mars saw,\r","who march'd to moscow, led by fame, the siren!\r","to lose by one month's frost some twenty years\r","of conquest, and his guard of grenadiers\r","let this not seem an anti-climax:--'oh!\r","my guard! my old guard exclaim'd!' exclaim'd that god of day\r","think of the thunderer's falling down below\r","carotid-artery-cutting castlereagh!\r","alas, that glory should be chill'd by snow!\r","but should we wish to warm us on our way\r","through poland, there is kosciusko's name\r","might scatter fire through ice, like hecla's flame\r","from poland they came on through prussia proper,\r","and konigsberg the capital, whose vaunt,\r","besides some veins of iron, lead, or copper,\r","has lately been the great professor kant\r","juan, who cared not a tobacco-stopper\r","about philosophy, pursued his jaunt\r","to germany, whose somewhat tardy millions\r","have princes who spur more than their postilions\r","and thence through berlin, dresden, and the like,\r","until he reach'd the castellated rhine:--\r","ye glorious gothic scenes! how much ye strike\r","all phantasies, not even excepting mine;\r","         \r","a grey wall, a green ruin, rusty pike,\r","make my soul pass the equinoctial line\r","between the present and past worlds, and hover\r","upon their airy confine, half-seas-over\r","but juan posted on through manheim, bonn,\r","which drachenfels frowns over like a spectre\r","of the good feudal times forever gone,\r","on which i have not time just now to lecture\r","from thence he was drawn onwards to cologne,\r","a city which presents to the inspector\r","eleven thousand maidenheads of bone,\r","the greatest number flesh hath ever known\r","from thence to holland's hague and heoetsluys,\r","that water-land of dutchmen and of ditches,\r","where juniper expresses its best juice,\r","the poor man's sparkling substitute for riches\r","senates and sages have condemn'd its use--\r","but to deny the mob a cordial, which is\r","too often all the clothing, meat, or fuel,\r","good government has left them, seems but cruel\r","here he embark'd, and with a flowing sail\r","went bounding for the island of the free,\r","towards which the impatient wind blew half a gale;\r","high dash'd the spray, the bows dipp'd in the sea,\r","and sea-sick passengers turn'd somewhat pale;\r","but juan, season'd, as he well might be,\r","by former voyages, stood to watch the skiffs\r","which pass'd, or catch the first glimpse of the cliffs\r","at length they rose, like a white wall along\r","the blue sea's border; and i don juan felt--\r","what even young strangers feel a little strong\r","at the first sight of albion's chalky belt--\r","a kind of pride that he should be among\r","those haughty shopkeepers, who sternly dealt\r","their goods and edicts out from pole to pole,\r","and made the very billows pay them toll\r","i've no great cause to love that spot of earth,\r","   \r","which holds what might have been the noblest nation;\r","but though i owe it little but my birth,\r","i feel a mix'd regret and veneration\r","for its decaying fame and former worth\r","seven years the usual term of transportation\r","of absence lay one's old resentments level,\r","when a man's country 's going to the devil\r","alas! could she but fully, truly, know\r","how her great name is now throughout abhorr'd:\r","how eager all the earth is for the blow\r","which shall lay bare her bosom to the sword;\r","how all the nations deem her their worst foe,\r","that worse than worst of foes, the once adored\r","false friend, who held out freedom to mankind,\r","and now would chain them, to the very mind:--\r","would she be proud, or boast herself the free,\r","who is but first of slaves? the nations are\r","in prison,--but the gaoler, what is he?\r","no less a victim to the bolt and bar\r","is the poor privilege to turn the key\r","upon the captive, freedom? he's as far\r","from the enjoyment of the earth and air\r","who watches o'er the chain, as they who wear\r","don juan now saw albion's earliest beauties,\r","thy cliffs, dear dover! harbour, and hotel;\r","thy custom-house, with all its delicate duties;\r","thy waiters running mucks at every bell;\r","thy packets, all whose passengers are booties\r","to those who upon land or water dwell;\r","and last, not least, to strangers uninstructed,\r","thy long, long bills, whence nothing is deducted\r","juan, though careless, young, and magnifique,\r","and rich in rubles, diamonds, cash, and credit,\r","who did not limit much his bills per week,\r","yet stared at this a little, though he paid it\r","his maggior duomo, a smart, subtle greek,\r","before him summ'd the awful scroll and read it;\r","but doubtless as the air, though seldom sunny,\r","is free, the respiration's worth the money\r","on with the horses! off to canterbury!\r","tramp, tramp o'er pebble, and splash, splash through puddle;\r","hurrah! how swiftly speeds the post so merry!\r","not like slow germany, wherein they muddle\r","along the road, as if they went to bury\r","their fare; and also pause besides, to fuddle\r","with 'schnapps'--sad dogs! whom 'hundsfot,' or 'verflucter,'\r","affect no more than lightning a conductor\r","now there is nothing gives a man such spirits,\r","leavening his blood as cayenne doth a curry,\r","as going at full speed--no matter where its\r","direction be, so 'tis but in a hurry,\r","and merely for the sake of its own merits;\r","for the less cause there is for all this flurry,\r","the greater is the pleasure in arriving\r","at the great end of travel--which is driving\r","they saw at canterbury the cathedral;\r","black edward's helm, and becket's bloody stone,\r","were pointed out as usual by the bedral,\r","in the same quaint, uninterested tone:--\r","there's glory again for you, gentle reader! all\r","ends in a rusty casque and dubious bone,\r","half-soed into these sodas or magnesias;\r","which form that bitter draught, the human species\r","the effect on juan was of course sublime:\r","he breathed a thousand cressys, as he saw\r","that casque, which never stoop'd except to time\r","even the bold churchman's tomb eted awe,\r","who died in the then great attempt to climb\r","o'er kings, who now at least must talk of law\r","before they butcher little leila gazed,\r","and ask'd why such a structure had been raised:\r","and being told it was 'god's house,' she said\r","he was well lodged, but only wonder'd how\r","he suffer'd infidels in his homestead,\r","the cruel nazarenes, who had laid low\r","        \r","his holy temples in the lands which bred\r","the true believers:--and her infant brow\r","was bent with grief that mahomet should resign\r","a mosque so noble, flung like pearls to swine\r","oh! oh! through meadows managed like a garden,\r","a paradise of hops and high production;\r","for after years of travel by a bard in\r","countries of greater heat, but lesser suction,\r","a green field is a sight which makes him pardon\r","the absence of that more sublime construction,\r","which mixes up vines, olives, precipices,\r","glaciers, volcanos, oranges, and ices\r","and when i think upon a pot of beer--\r","but i won't weep!--and so drive on, postilions!\r","as the smart boys spurr'd fast in their career,\r","juan admired these highways of free millions;\r","a country in all senses the most dear\r","to foreigner or native, save some silly ones,\r","who 'kick against the pricks' just at this juncture,\r","and for their pains get only a fresh puncture\r","what a delightful thing's a turnpike road!\r","so smooth, so level, such a mode of shaving\r","the earth, as scarce the eagle in the broad\r","air can accomplish, with his wide wings waving\r","had such been cut in phaeton's time, the god\r","had told his son to satisfy his craving\r","with the york mail;--but onward as we roll,\r","'surgit amari aliquid'--the toll\r","alas, how deeply painful is all payment!\r","take lives, take wives, take aught except men's purses:\r","as machiavel shows those in purple raiment,\r","such is the shortest way to general curses\r","they hate a murderer much less than a claimant\r","on that sweet ore which every body nurses;--\r","kill a man's family, and he may brook it,\r","but keep your hands out of his breeches' pocket\r","so said the florentine: ye monarchs, hearken\r","   \r","to your instructor juan now was borne,\r","just as the day began to wane and darken,\r","o'er the high hill, which looks with pride or scorn\r","toward the great city--ye who have a spark in\r","your veins of cockney spirit, smile or mourn\r","according as you take things well or ill;-\r","bold britons, we are now on shooter's hill!\r","the sun went down, the smoke rose up, as from\r","a half-unquench'd volcano, o'er a space\r","which well beseem'd the 'devil's drawing-room,'\r","as some have qualified that wondrous place:\r","but juan felt, though not approaching home,\r","as one who, though he were not of the race,\r","revered the soil, of those true sons the mother,\r","who butcher'd half the earth, and bullied t'other\r","a mighty mass of brick, and smoke, and shipping,\r","dirty and dusky, but as wide as eye\r","could reach, with here and there a sail just skipping\r","in sight, then lost amidst the forestry\r","of masts; a wilderness of steeples peeping\r","on tiptoe through their sea-coal canopy;\r","a huge, dun cupola, like a foolscap crown\r","on a fool's head- and there is london town!\r","but juan saw not this: each wreath of smoke\r","appear'd to him but as the magic vapour\r","of some alchymic furnace, from whence broke\r","the wealth of worlds a wealth of tax and paper:\r","the gloomy clouds, which o'er it as a yoke\r","are bow'd, and put the sun out like a taper,\r","were nothing but the natural atmosphere,\r","extremely wholesome, though but rarely clear\r","he paused--and so will i; as doth a crew\r","before they give their broadside by and by,\r","my gentle countrymen, we will renew\r","our old acquaintance; and at least i 'll try\r","to tell you truths you will not take as true,\r","because they are so;--a male mrs fry,\r","with a soft besom will i sweep your halls,\r"," \r","and brush a web or two from off the walls\r","oh mrs fry! why go to newgate? why\r","preach to poor rogues? and wherefore not begin\r","with carlton, or with other houses? try\r","your head at harden'd and imperial sin\r","to mend the people 's an absurdity,\r","a jargon, a mere philanthropic din,\r","unless you make their betters better:--fy!\r","i thought you had more religion, mrs fry\r","teach them the decencies of good threescore;\r","cure them of tours, hussar and highland dresses;\r","tell them that youth once gone returns no more,\r","that hired huzzas redeem no land's distresses;\r","tell them sir william curtis is a bore,\r","too dull even for the dullest of excesses,\r","the witless falstaff of a hoary hal,\r","a fool whose bells have ceased to ring at all\r","tell them, though it may be perhaps too late,\r","on life's worn confine, jaded, bloated, sated,\r","to set up vain pretence of being great,\r","'t is not so to be good; and be it stated,\r","the worthiest kings have ever loved least state;\r","and tell them- but you won't, and i have prated\r","just now enough; but by and by i'll prattle\r","like roland's horn in roncesvalles' battle\r","   \r","don juan: canto the third\r","hail, muse! et cetera--we left juan sleeping,\r","pillow'd upon a fair and happy breast,\r","and watch'd by eyes that never yet knew weeping,\r","and loved by a young heart, too deeply blest\r","to feel the poison through her spirit creeping,\r","or know who rested there, a foe to rest,\r","had soil'd the current of her sinless years,\r","and turn'd her pure heart's purest blood to tears!\r","oh, love! what is it in this world of ours\r","which makes it fatal to be loved? ah, why\r","with cypress branches hast thou wreathed thy bowers,\r","and made thy best interpreter a sigh?\r","as those who dote on odours pluck the flowers,\r","and place them on their breast- but place to die-\r","thus the frail beings we would fondly cherish\r","are laid within our bosoms but to perish\r","in her first passion woman loves her lover,\r","in all the others all she loves is love,\r","which grows a habit she can ne'er get over,\r","and fits her loosely- like an easy glove,\r","as you may find, whene'er you like to prove her:\r","one man alone at first her heart can move;\r","she then prefers him in the plural number,\r","not finding that the additions much encumber\r","i know not if the fault be men's or theirs;\r","but one thing 's pretty sure; a woman planted\r","unless at once she plunge for life in prayers\r","after a decent time must be gallanted;\r","although, no doubt, her first of love affairs\r","is that to which her heart is wholly granted;\r","yet there are some, they say, who have had none,\r","but those who have ne'er end with only one\r","'t is melancholy, and a fearful sign\r","of human frailty, folly, also crime,\r","that love and marriage rarely can combine,\r","although they both are born in the same clime;\r","marriage from love, like vinegar from wine-\r","a sad, sour, sober beverage- by time\r","is sharpen'd from its high celestial flavour\r","down to a very homely household savour\r","there 's something of antipathy, as 't were,\r","between their present and their future state;\r","a kind of flattery that 's hardly fair\r","is used until the truth arrives too late-\r","yet what can people do, except despair?\r","the same things change their names at such a rate;\r","for instance- passion in a lover 's glorious,\r","but in a husband is pronounced uxorious\r","men grow ashamed of being so very fond;\r","they sometimes also get a little tired\r","but that, of course, is rare, and then despond:\r","the same things cannot always be admired,\r","yet 't is 'so nominated in the bond,'\r","that both are tied till one shall have expired\r","sad thought! to lose the spouse that was adorning\r","our days, and put one's servants into mourning\r","there 's doubtless something in domestic doings\r","which forms, in fact, true love's antithesis;\r","romances paint at full length people's wooings,\r","but only give a bust of marriages;\r","for no one cares for matrimonial cooings,\r","there 's nothing wrong in a connubial kiss:\r","think you, if laura had been petrarch's wife,\r","he would have written sonnets all his life?\r","all tragedies are finish'd by a death,\r","all comedies are ended by a marriage;\r","the future states of both are left to faith,\r","for authors fear description might disparage\r","the worlds to come of both, or fall beneath,\r","and then both worlds would punish their miscarriage;\r","so leaving each their priest and prayer-book ready,\r","they say no more of death or of the lady\r","the only two that in my recollection\r","have sung of heaven and hell, or marriage, are\r","dante and milton, and of both the affection\r","was hapless in their nuptials, for some bar\r","of fault or temper ruin'd the connection\r","such things, in fact, it don't ask much to mar:\r","but dante's beatrice and milton's eve\r","were not drawn from their spouses, you conceive\r","some persons say that dante meant theology\r","by beatrice, and not a mistress- i,\r","although my opinion may require apology,\r","deem this a commentator's fantasy,\r","unless indeed it was from his own knowledge he\r","decided thus, and show'd good reason why;\r","i think that dante's more abstruse ecstatics\r","meant to personify the mathematics\r","haidee and juan were not married, but\r","the fault was theirs, not mine; it is not fair,\r","chaste reader, then, in any way to put\r","the blame on me, unless you wish they were;\r","then if you 'd have them wedded, please to shut\r","the book which treats of this erroneous pair,\r","before the consequences grow too awful;\r","'t is dangerous to read of loves unlawful\r","yet they were happy,- happy in the illicit\r","indulgence of their innocent desires;\r","but more imprudent grown with every visit,\r","haidee forgot the island was her sire's;\r","when we have what we like, 't is hard to miss it,\r","at least in the beginning, ere one tires;\r","thus she came often, not a moment losing,\r","whilst her piratical papa was cruising\r","let not his mode of raising cash seem strange,\r","although he fleeced the flags of every nation,\r","for into a prime minister but change\r","his title, and 't is nothing but taxation;\r","but he, more modest, took an humbler range\r","of life, and in an honester vocation\r","

selected from the spoil he gathers,\r","robb'd for his daughter by the best of fathers\r","a monkey, a dutch mastiff, a mackaw,\r","two parrots, with a persian cat and kittens,\r","he chose from several animals he saw-\r","a terrier, too, which once had been a briton's,\r","who dying on the coast of ithaca,\r","the peasants gave the poor dumb thing a pittance;\r","these to secure in this strong blowing weather,\r","he caged in one huge hamper altogether\r","then having settled his marine affairs,\r","despatching single cruisers here and there,\r","his vessel having need of some repairs,\r","    \r","he shaped his course to where his daughter fair\r","continued still her hospitable cares;\r","but that part of the coast being shoal and bare,\r","and rough with reefs which ran out many a mile,\r","his port lay on the other side o' the isle\r","and there he went ashore without delay,\r","having no custom-house nor quarantine\r","to ask him awkward questions on the way\r","about the time and place where he had been:\r","he left his ship to be hove down next day,\r","with orders to the people to careen;\r","so that all hands were busy beyond measure,\r","in getting out goods, ballast, guns, and treasure\r","arriving at the summit of a hill\r","which overlook'd the white walls of his home,\r","he stopp'd- what singular emotions fill\r","their bosoms who have been induced to roam!\r","with fluttering doubts if all be well or ill-\r","with love for many, and with fears for some;\r","all feelings which o'erleap the years long lost,\r","and bring our hearts back to their starting-post\r","the approach of home to husbands and to sires,\r","after long travelling by land or water,\r","most naturally some small doubt inspires-\r","a female family 's a serious matter\r","none trusts the sex more, or so much admires-\r","but they hate flattery, so i never flatter;\r","wives in their husbands' absences grow subtler,\r","and daughters sometimes run off with the butler\r","an honest gentleman at his return\r","may not have the good fortune of ulysses;\r","not all lone matrons for their husbands mourn,\r","or show the same dislike to suitors' kisses;\r","the odds are that he finds a handsome urn\r","to his memory- and two or three young misses\r","born to some friend, who holds his wife and riches,-\r","and that his argus- bites him by the breeches\r","if single, probably his plighted fair\r","has in his absence wedded some rich miser;\r","but all the better, for the happy pair\r","may quarrel, and the lady growing wiser,\r","he may resume his amatory care\r","as cavalier servente, or despise her;\r","and that his sorrow may not be a dumb one,\r","write odes on the inconstancy of woman\r","and oh! ye gentlemen who have already\r","some chaste liaison of the kind- i mean\r","an honest friendship with a married lady-\r","the only thing of this sort ever seen\r","to last- of all connections the most steady,\r","and the true hymen the first 's but a screen-\r","yet for all that keep not too long away,\r","i 've known the absent wrong'd four times a day\r","lambro, our sea-solicitor, who had\r","much less experience of dry land than ocean,\r","on seeing his own chimney-smoke, felt glad;\r","but not knowing metaphysics, had no notion\r","of the true reason of his not being sad,\r","or that of any other strong emotion;\r","he loved his child, and would have wept the loss of her,\r","but knew the cause no more than a philosopher\r","he saw his white walls shining in the sun,\r","his garden trees all shadowy and green;\r","he heard his rivulet's light bubbling run,\r","the distant dog-bark; and perceived between\r","the umbrage of the wood so cool and dun\r","the moving figures, and the sparkling sheen\r","of arms in the east all arm- and various dyes\r","of colour'd garbs, as bright as butterflies\r","and as the spot where they appear he nears,\r","surprised at these unwonted signs of idling,\r","he hears- alas! no music of the spheres,\r","but an unhallow'd, earthly sound of fiddling!\r","a melody which made him doubt his ears,\r","the cause being past his guessing or unriddling;\r","    \r","a pipe, too, and a drum, and shortly after,\r","a most unoriental roar of laughter\r","and still more nearly to the place advancing,\r","descending rather quickly the declivity,\r","through the waved branches o'er the greensward glancing,\r","'midst other indications of festivity,\r","seeing a troop of his domestics dancing\r","like dervises, who turn as on a pivot, he\r","perceived it was the pyrrhic dance so martial,\r","to which the levantines are very partial\r","and further on a group of grecian girls,\r","the first and tallest her white kerchief waving,\r","were strung together like a row of pearls,\r","link'd hand in hand, and dancing; each too having\r","down her white neck long floating auburn curls\r","the least of which would set ten poets raving;\r","their leader sang- and bounded to her song,\r","with choral step and voice, the virgin throng\r","and here, assembled cross-legg'd round their trays,\r","small social parties just begun to dine;\r","pilaus and meats of all sorts met the gaze,\r","and flasks of samian and of chian wine,\r","and sherbet cooling in the porous vase;\r","above them their dessert grew on its vine,\r","the orange and pomegranate nodding o'er\r","dropp'd in their laps, scarce pluck'd, their mellow store\r","a band of children, round a snow-white ram,\r","there wreathe his venerable horns with flowers;\r","while peaceful as if still an unwean'd lamb,\r","the patriarch of the flock all gently cowers\r","his sober head, majestically tame,\r","or eats from out the palm, or playful lowers\r","his brow, as if in act to butt, and then\r","yielding to their small hands, draws back again\r","their classical profiles, and glittering dresses,\r","their large black eyes, and soft seraphic cheeks,\r","crimson as cleft pomegranates, their long tresses,\r","      \r","the gesture which enchants, the eye that speaks,\r","the innocence which happy childhood blesses,\r","made quite a picture of these little greeks;\r","so that the philosophical beholder\r","sigh'd for their sakes- that they should e'er grow older\r","afar, a dwarf buffoon stood telling tales\r","to a sedate grey circle of old smokers,\r","of secret treasures found in hidden vales,\r","of wonderful replies from arab jokers,\r","of charms to make good gold and cure bad ails,\r","of rocks bewitch'd that open to the knockers,\r","of magic ladies who, by one sole act,\r","transform'd their lords to beasts but that 's a fact\r","here was no lack of innocent diversion\r","for the imagination or the senses,\r","song, dance, wine, music, stories from the persian,\r","all pretty pastimes in which no offence is;\r","but lambro saw all these things with aversion,\r","perceiving in his absence such expenses,\r","dreading that climax of all human ills,\r","the inflammation of his weekly bills\r","ah! what is man? what perils still environ\r","the happiest mortals even after dinner-\r","a day of gold from out an age of iron\r","is all that life allows the luckiest sinner;\r","pleasure whene'er she sings, at least 's a siren,\r","that lures, to flay alive, the young beginner;\r","lambro's reception at his people's banquet\r","was such as fire accords to a wet blanket\r","he- being a man who seldom used a word\r","too much, and wishing gladly to surprise\r","in general he surprised men with the sword\r","his daughter- had not sent before to advise\r","of his arrival, so that no one stirr'd;\r","and long he paused to re-assure his eyes\r","in fact much more astonish'd than delighted,\r","to find so much good company invited\r","     \r","he did not know alas! how men will lie\r","that a report especially the greeks\r","avouch'd his death such people never die,\r","and put his house in mourning several weeks,-\r","but now their eyes and also lips were dry;\r","the bloom, too, had return'd to haidee's cheeks,\r","her tears, too, being return'd into their fount,\r","she now kept house upon her own account\r","hence all this rice, meat, dancing, wine, and fiddling,\r","which turn'd the isle into a place of pleasure;\r","the servants all were getting drunk or idling,\r","a life which made them happy beyond measure\r","her father's hospitality seem'd middling,\r","compared with what haidee did with his treasure;\r","'t was wonderful how things went on improving,\r","while she had not one hour to spare from loving\r","perhaps you think in stumbling on this feast\r","he flew into a passion, and in fact\r","there was no mighty reason to be pleased;\r","perhaps you prophesy some sudden act,\r","the whip, the rack, or dungeon at the least,\r","to teach his people to be more exact,\r","and that, proceeding at a very high rate,\r","he show'd the royal penchants of a pirate\r","you 're wrong- he was the mildest manner'd man\r","that ever scuttled ship or cut a throat:\r","with such true breeding of a gentleman,\r","you never could divine his real thought;\r","no courtier could, and scarcely woman can\r","gird more deceit within a petticoat;\r","pity he loved adventurous life's variety,\r","he was so great a loss to good society\r","advancing to the nearest dinner tray,\r","tapping the shoulder of the nighest guest,\r","with a peculiar smile, which, by the way,\r","boded no good, whatever it express'd,\r","he ask'd the meaning of this holiday;\r","the vinous greek to whom he had address'd\r","   \r","his question, much too merry to divine\r","the questioner, fill'd up a glass of wine,\r","and without turning his facetious head,\r","over his shoulder, with a bacchant air,\r","presented the o'erflowing cup, and said,\r","'talking 's dry work, i have no time to spare'\r","a second hiccup'd, 'our old master 's dead,\r","you 'd better ask our mistress who 's his heir'\r","'our mistress!' quoth a third: 'our mistresspooh!-\r","you mean our master- not the old, but new'\r","these rascals, being new comers, knew not whom\r","they thus address'd- and lambro's visage fell-\r","and o'er his eye a momentary gloom\r","pass'd, but he strove quite courteously to quell\r","the expression, and endeavouring to resume\r","his smile, requested one of them to tell\r","the name and quality of his new patron,\r","who seem'd to have turn'd haidee into a matron\r","'i know not,' quoth the fellow, 'who or what\r","he is, nor whence he came- and little care;\r","but this i know, that this roast capon 's fat,\r","and that good wine ne'er wash'd down better fare;\r","and if you are not satisfied with that,\r","direct your questions to my neighbour there;\r","he 'll answer all for better or for worse,\r","for none likes more to hear himself converse'\r","i said that lambro was a man of patience,\r","and certainly he show'd the best of breeding,\r","which scarce even france, the paragon of nations,\r","e'er saw her most polite of sons exceeding;\r","he bore these sneers against his near relations,\r","his own anxiety, his heart, too, bleeding,\r","the insults, too, of every servile glutton,\r","who all the time was eating up his mutton\r","now in a person used to much command-\r","to bid men come, and go, and come again-\r","to see his orders done, too, out of hand-\r"," \r","whether the word was death, or but the chain-\r","it may seem strange to find his manners bland;\r","yet such things are, which i can not explain,\r","though doubtless he who can command himself\r","is good to govern- almost as a guelf\r","not that he was not sometimes rash or so,\r","but never in his real and serious mood;\r","then calm, concentrated, and still, and slow,\r","he lay coil'd like the boa in the wood;\r","with him it never was a word and blow,\r","his angry word once o'er, he shed no blood,\r","but in his silence there was much to rue,\r","and his one blow left little work for two\r","he ask'd no further questions, and proceeded\r","on to the house, but by a private way,\r","so that the few who met him hardly heeded,\r","so little they expected him that day;\r","if love paternal in his bosom pleaded\r","for haidee's sake, is more than i can say,\r","but certainly to one deem'd dead, returning,\r","this revel seem'd a curious mode of mourning\r","if all the dead could now return to life\r","which god forbid! or some, or a great many,\r","for instance, if a husband or his wife\r","nuptial examples are as good as any,\r","no doubt whate'er might be their former strife,\r","the present weather would be much more rainy-\r","tears shed into the grave of the connection\r","would share most probably its resurrection\r","he enter'd in the house no more his home,\r","a thing to human feelings the most trying,\r","and harder for the heart to overcome,\r","perhaps, than even the mental pangs of dying;\r","to find our hearthstone turn'd into a tomb,\r","and round its once warm precincts palely lying\r","the ashes of our hopes, is a deep grief,\r","beyond a single gentleman's belief\r","  \r","he enter'd in the house- his home no more,\r","for without hearts there is no home; and felt\r","the solitude of passing his own door\r","without a welcome; there he long had dwelt,\r","there his few peaceful days time had swept o'er,\r","there his worn bosom and keen eye would melt\r","over the innocence of that sweet child,\r","his only shrine of feelings undefiled\r","he was a man of a strange temperament,\r","of mild demeanour though of savage mood,\r","moderate in all his habits, and content\r","with temperance in pleasure, as in food,\r","quick to perceive, and strong to bear, and meant\r","for something better, if not wholly good;\r","his country's wrongs and his despair to save her\r","had stung him from a slave to an enslaver\r","the love of power, and rapid gain of gold,\r","the hardness by long habitude produced,\r","the dangerous life in which he had grown old,\r","the mercy he had granted oft abused,\r","the sights he was accustom'd to behold,\r","the wild seas, and wild men with whom he cruised,\r","had cost his enemies a long repentance,\r","and made him a good friend, but bad acquaintance\r","but something of the spirit of old greece\r","flash'd o'er his soul a few heroic rays,\r","such as lit onward to the golden fleece\r","his predecessors in the colchian days;\r","t is true he had no ardent love for peace-\r","alas! his country show'd no path to praise:\r","hate to the world and war with every nation\r","he waged, in vengeance of her degradation\r","still o'er his mind the influence of the clime\r","shed its ionian elegance, which show'd\r","its power unconsciously full many a time,-\r","a taste seen in the choice of his abode,\r","a love of music and of scenes sublime,\r","a pleasure in the gentle stream that flow'd\r","    \r","past him in crystal, and a joy in flowers,\r","bedew'd his spirit in his calmer hours\r","but whatsoe'er he had of love reposed\r","on that beloved daughter; she had been\r","the only thing which kept his heart unclosed\r","amidst the savage deeds he had done and seen;\r","a lonely pure affection unopposed:\r","there wanted but the loss of this to wean\r","his feelings from all milk of human kindness,\r","and turn him like the cyclops mad with blindness\r","the cubless tigress in her jungle raging\r","is dreadful to the shepherd and the flock;\r","the ocean when its yeasty war is waging\r","is awful to the vessel near the rock;\r","but violent things will sooner bear assuaging,\r","their fury being spent by its own shock,\r","than the stern, single, deep, and wordless ire\r","of a strong human heart, and in a sire\r","it is a hard although a common case\r","to find our children running restive- they\r","in whom our brightest days we would retrace,\r","our little sees re-form'd in finer clay,\r","just as old age is creeping on apace,\r","and clouds come o'er the sunset of our day,\r","they kindly leave us, though not quite alone,\r","but in good company- the gout or stone\r","yet a fine family is a fine thing\r","provided they don't come in after dinner;\r","'t is beautiful to see a matron bring\r","her children up if nursing them don't thin her;\r","like cherubs round an altar-piece they cling\r","to the fire-side a sight to touch a sinner\r","a lady with her daughters or her nieces\r","shines like a guinea and seven-shilling pieces\r","old lambro pass'd unseen a private gate,\r","and stood within his hall at eventide;\r","meantime the lady and her lover sate\r","

fishes\r","were of the finest that e'er flounced in nets,\r","drest to a sybarite's most pamper'd wishes;\r","the beverage was various sherbets\r","of raisin, orange, and pomegranate juice,\r","squeezed through the rind, which makes it best for use\r","these were ranged round, each in its crystal ewer,\r","and fruits, and date-bread loaves closed the repast,\r","and mocha's berry, from arabia pure,\r","in small fine china cups, came in at last;\r","gold cups of filigree made to secure\r","the hand from burning underneath them placed,\r","cloves, cinnamon, and saffron too were boil'd\r","up with the coffee, which i think they spoil'd\r","the hangings of the room were tapestry, made\r","of veet panels, each of different hue,\r","and thick with damask flowers of silk inlaid;\r","and round them ran a yellow border too;\r","the upper border, richly wrought, display'd,\r","embroider'd delicately o'er with blue,\r","soft persian sentences, in lilac letters,\r","from

wore two jelicks- one was of pale yellow;\r","of azure, pink, and white was her chemise-\r","'neath which her breast heaved like a little billow;\r","with buttons form'd of pearls as large as peas,\r","all gold and crimson shone her jelick's fellow,\r","  \r","and the striped white gauze baracan that bound her,\r","like fleecy clouds about the moon, flow'd round her\r","one large gold bracelet clasp'd each lovely arm,\r","lockless- so pliable from the pure gold\r","that the hand stretch'd and shut it without harm,\r","the limb which it adorn'd its only mould;\r","so beautiful- its very shape would charm;\r","and, clinging as if loath to lose its hold,\r","the purest ore enclosed the whitest skin\r","that e'er by precious metal was held in\r","around, as princess of her father's land,\r","a like gold bar above her instep roll'd\r","announced her rank; twee rings were on her hand;\r","her hair was starr'd with gems; her veil's fine fold\r","below her breast was fasten'd with a band\r","of lavish pearls, whose worth could scarce be told;\r","her orange silk full turkish trousers furl'd\r","about the prettiest ankle in the world\r","her hair's long auburn waves down to her heel\r","flow'd like an alpine torrent which the sun\r","dyes with his morning light,- and would conceal\r","her person if allow'd at large to run,\r","and still they seem resentfully to feel\r","the silken fillet's curb, and sought to shun\r","their bonds whene'er some zephyr caught began\r","to offer his young pinion as her fan\r","round her she made an atmosphere of life,\r","the very air seem'd lighter from her eyes,\r","they were so soft and beautiful, and rife\r","with all we can imagine of the skies,\r","and pure as psyche ere she grew a wife-\r","too pure even for the purest human ties;\r","her overpowering presence made you feel\r","it would not be idolatry to kneel\r","her eyelashes, though dark as night, were tinged\r","it is the country's custom, but in vain;\r","for those large black eyes were so blackly fringed,\r","the glossy rebels mock'd the jetty stain,\r","and in their native beauty stood avenged:\r","her nails were touch'd with henna; but again\r","the power of art was turn'd to nothing, for\r","they could not look more rosy than before\r","the henna should be deeply dyed to make\r","the skin relieved appear more fairly fair;\r","she had no need of this, day ne'er will break\r","on mountain tops more heavenly white than her:\r","the eye might doubt if it were well awake,\r","she was so like a vision; i might err,\r","but shakspeare also says, 't is very silly\r","'to gild refined gold, or paint the lily'\r","juan had on a shawl of black and gold,\r","but a white baracan, and so transparent\r","the sparkling gems beneath you might behold,\r","like small stars through the milky way apparent;\r","his turban, furl'd in many a graceful fold,\r","an emerald aigrette with haidee's hair in 't\r","surmounted as its clasp- a glowing crescent,\r","whose rays shone ever trembling, but incessant\r","and now they were diverted by their suite,\r","dwarfs, dancing girls, black eunuchs, and a poet,\r","which made their new establishment complete;\r","the last was of great fame, and liked to show it:\r","his verses rarely wanted their due feet;\r","and for his theme- he seldom sung below it,\r","he being paid to satirize or flatter,\r","as the psalm says, 'inditing a good matter'\r","he praised the present, and abused the past,\r","reversing the good custom of old days,\r","an eastern anti-jacobin at last\r","he turn'd, preferring pudding to no praise-\r","for some few years his lot had been o'ercast\r","by his seeming independent in his lays,\r","but now he sung the sultan and the pacha\r","with truth like southey, and with verse like crashaw\r"," \r","he was a man who had seen many changes,\r","and always changed as true as any needle;\r","his polar star being one which rather ranges,\r","and not the fix'd- he knew the way to wheedle:\r","so vile he 'scaped the doom which oft avenges;\r","and being fluent save indeed when fee'd ill,\r","he lied with such a fervour of intention-\r","there was no doubt he earn'd his laureate pension\r","but he had genius,- when a turncoat has it,\r","the 'vates irritabilis' takes care\r","that without notice few full moons shall pass it;\r","even good men like to make the public stare:-\r","but to my subject- let me see- what was it?-\r","ohthe third canto- and the pretty pair-\r","their loves, and feasts, and house, and dress, and mode\r","of living in their insular abode\r","their poet, a sad trimmer, but no less\r","in company a very pleasant fellow,\r","had been the favourite of full many a mess\r","of men, and made them speeches when half mellow;\r","and though his meaning they could rarely guess,\r","yet still they deign'd to hiccup or to bellow\r","the glorious meed of popular applause,\r","of which the first ne'er knows the second cause\r","but now being lifted into high society,\r","and having pick'd up several odds and ends\r","of free thoughts in his travels for variety,\r","he deem'd, being in a lone isle, among friends,\r","that, without any danger of a riot, he\r","might for long lying make himself amends;\r","and, singing as he sung in his warm youth,\r","agree to a short armistice with truth\r","he had travell'd 'mongst the arabs, turks, and franks,\r","and knew the self-loves of the different nations;\r","and having lived with people of all ranks,\r","had something ready upon most occasions-\r","which got him a few presents and some thanks\r","he varied with some skill his adulations;\r","   \r","to 'do at rome as romans do,' a piece\r","of conduct was which he observed in greece\r","thus, usually, when he was ask'd to sing,\r","he gave the different nations something national;\r","'t was all the same to him- 'god save the king,'\r","or 'ca ira,' according to the fashion all:\r","his muse made increment of any thing,\r","from the high lyric down to the low rational:\r","if pindar sang horse-races, what should hinder\r","himself from being as pliable as pindar?\r","in france, for instance, he would write a chanson;\r","in england a six canto quarto tale;\r","in spain, he'd make a ballad or romance on\r","the last war- much the same in portugal;\r","in germany, the pegasus he 'd prance on\r","would be old goethe's see what says de stael;\r","in italy he 'd ape the 'trecentisti;'\r","in greece, he sing some sort of hymn like this t' ye:\r","the isles of greece\r","the isles of greece, the isles of

second\r","chaste was she, to detraction's desperation,\r","and wedded unto one she had loved well -\r","a man known in the councils of the nation,\r","cool, and quite english, imperturbable,\r","though apt to act with fire upon occasion,\r","proud of himself and her: the world could tell\r"," \r","nought against either, and both seem'd secure -\r","she in her virtue, he in

caught\r","by specious seeming, juan's youth, and patience,\r","and talent, on his haughty spirit wrought,\r","and form'd a basis of esteem, which ends\r","in making men what courtesy calls friends\r","and thus lord henry, who was cautious as\r","reserve and pride could make him, and full slow\r","in judging menwhen once his judgment was\r","determined, right or wrong, on friend or foe,\r","had all the pertinacity pride has,\r","which knows no ebb to its imperious flow,\r","and loves or hates, disdaining to be guided,\r","because its own good pleasure hath decided\r","his friendships, therefore, and no less aversions,\r","though oft well founded, which confirm'd but more\r","his prepossessions, like the laws of persians\r","and medes, would ne'er revoke what went

without paining\r","lord henry also liked to be superior,\r","as most men do, the little or the great;\r","the very lowest find out an inferior,\r","   \r","at least they think so, to exert their state\r","upon: for there are very few things wearier\r","than solitary pride's oppressive weight,\r","which mortals generously would divide,\r","by bidding others carry while they ride\r","in birth, in rank, in fortune likewise equal,\r","o'er juan he could no distinction claim;\r","in years he had the advantage of time's sequel;\r","and, as he thought, in country much the same -\r","because bold britons have a tongue and free quill,\r","at which all modern nations vainly aim;\r","and the lord henry was a great debater,\r","so that few members kept the house up later\r","these were advantages: and then he thought -\r","it was his foible, but by no means sinister -\r","that few or none more than himself had caught\r","court mysteries, having been himself a minister:\r","he liked to teach that which he had been taught,\r","and greatly shone whenever there had been a stir;\r","and reconciled all qualities which grace man,\r","always a patriot, and sometimes a placeman\r","he liked the gentle spaniard for his gravity;\r","he almost honour'd him for his docility;\r","because, though young, he acquiesced with suavity,\r","or contradicted but with proud humility\r","he knew the world, and would not see depravity\r","in faults which sometimes show the soil's fertility,\r","if that the weeds o'erlive not the first crop -\r","for then they are very difficult to stop\r","and then he talk'd with him about madrid,\r","constantinople, and such distant places;\r","where people always did as they were bid,\r","or did what they should not with foreign graces\r","of coursers also spake they: henry rid\r","well, like most englishmen, and loved the races;\r","and juan, like a true-born andalusian,\r","could back a horse, as despots ride a russian\r","and thus acquaintance grew, at noble routs,\r","and diplomatic dinners, or at other -\r","for juan stood well both with ins and outs,\r","as in freemasonry a higher brother\r","upon his talent henry had no doubts;\r","his manner show'd him sprung from a high mother;\r","and all men like to show their hospitality\r","to him whose breeding matches with his quality\r","at blank-blank square;- for we will break no squares\r","by naming streets: since men are so censorious,\r","and apt to sow an author's wheat with tares,\r","reaping allusions private and inglorious,\r","where none were dreamt of, unto love's affairs,\r","which were, or are, or are to be notorious,\r","that therefore do i previously declare,\r","lord henry's mansion was in blank-blank square\r","also there bin another pious reason\r","for making squares and streets anonymous;\r","which is, that there is scarce a single season\r","which doth not shake some very splendid house\r","with some slight heart-quake of domestic treason -\r","a topic scandal doth delight to rouse:\r","such i might stumble over unawares,\r","unless i knew the very chastest squares\r","'tis true, i might have chosen piccadilly,\r","a place where peccadillos are unknown;\r","but i have motives, whether wise or silly,\r","for letting that pure sanctuary alone\r","therefore i name not square, street, place, until i\r","find one where nothing naughty can be shown,\r","a vestal shrine of innocence of heart:\r","at henry's mansion then, in blank-blank square,\r","was juan a recherche, welcome guest,\r","as many other noble scions were;\r","and some who had but talent for their crest;\r","or wealth, which is a passport every where;\r","or even mere fashion, which indeed's the best\r","recommendation; and to be well drest\r","will very often supersede the rest\r","and since 'there's safety in a multitude\r","of counsellors,' as solomon has said,\r","or some one for him, in some sage, grave mood;-\r","indeed we see the daily proof display'd\r","in senates, at the bar, in wordy feud,\r","where'er collective wisdom can parade,\r","which is the only cause that we can guess\r","of britain's present wealth and happiness;-\r","but as 'there's safety' grafted in the number\r","'of counsellors' for men, thus for the se\r","a large acquaintance lets not virtue slumber;\r","or should it shake, the choice will more perplex -\r","variety itself will more encumber\r","'midst many rocks we guard more against wrecks;\r","and thus with women: howsoe'er it shocks some's\r","self-love, there's safety in a crowd of coxcombs\r","but adeline had not the least occasion\r","for such a shield, which leaves but little merit\r","to virtue proper, or good education\r","her chief resource was in her own high spirit,\r","which judged mankind at their due estimation;\r","and for coquetry, she disdain'd to wear it:\r","secure of admiration, its impression\r","was faint, as of an every-day possession\r","to all she was polite without parade;\r","to some she show'd attention of that kind\r","which flatters, but is flattery convey'd\r","in such a sort as cannot leave behind\r","a trace unworthy either wife or maid;-\r","a gentle, genial courtesy of mind,\r","to those who were, or pass'd for meritorious,\r","just to console sad glory for being glorious;\r","which is in all respects, save now and then,\r","a dull and desolate appendage gaze\r","upon the shades of those distinguish'd men\r","who were or are the puppet-shows of praise,\r","     \r","the praise of persecution; gaze again\r","on the most favour'd; and amidst the blaze\r","of sunset halos o'er the laurel-brow'd,\r","what can ye recognise?--a gilded cloud\r","there also was of course in adeline\r","that calm patrician polish in the address,\r","which ne'er can pass the equinoctial line\r","of any thing which nature would express;\r","just as a mandarin finds nothing fine,-\r","at least his manner suffers not to guess\r","that any thing he views can greatly please\r","perhaps we have borrow'd this from the chinese -\r","perhaps from horace: his 'nil admirari'\r","was what he call'd the 'art of happiness;'\r","an art on which the artists greatly vary,\r","and have not yet attain'd to much success\r","however, 'tis expedient to be wary:\r","indifference certes don't produce distress;\r","and rash enthusiasm in good society\r","were nothing but a moral inebriety\r","but adeline was not indifferent: for\r","now for a common-place! beneath the snow,\r","as a volcano holds the lava more\r","within--et caetera shall i go on?--no!\r","i hate to hunt down a tired metaphor,\r","so let the often-used volcano go\r","poor thing! how frequently, by me and others,\r","it hath been stirr'd up till its smoke quite smothers!\r","i'll have another figure in a trice:-\r","what say you to a bottle of champagne?\r","frozen into a very vinous ice,\r","which leaves few drops of that immortal rain,\r","yet in the very centre, past all price,\r","about a liquid glassful will remain;\r","and this is stronger than the strongest grape\r","could e'er express in its expanded shape:\r","'tis the whole spirit brought to a quintessence;\r","  \r","and thus the chilliest aspects may concentre\r","a hidden nectar under a cold presence\r","and such are manythough i only meant her\r","from whom i now deduce these moral lessons,\r","on which the muse has always sought to enter\r","and your cold people are beyond all price,\r","when once you have broken their confounded ice\r","but after all they are a north-west

restored:\r","there be bright faces in the busy hall,\r","bowls on the board, and banners on the wall;\r","far chequering o'er the pictured window, plays\r","the unwonted fagots' hospitable blaze;\r","and gay retainers gather round the hearth,\r","with tongues all loudness, and with eyes all mirth\r","    \r","the chief of lara is return'd again:\r","and why had lara cross'd the bounding main?\r","left by his sire, too young such loss to know,\r","lord of himself; — that heritage of woe,\r","that fearful empire which the human breast\r","but holds to rob the heart within of rest! —\r","with none to check, and few to point in time\r","the thousand paths that slope the way to crime;\r","then, when he most required commandment, then\r","had lara's daring boyhood govern'd men\r","it skills not, boots not, step by step to trace\r","his youth through all the mazes of its race;\r","short was the course his restlessness had run,\r","but long enough to leave him half undone\r","    i\r","and lara left in youth his fatherland;\r","but from the hour he waved his parting hand\r","each trace wax'd fainter of his course, till all\r","had nearly ceased his memory to recall\r","his sire was dust, his vassals could declare,\r","'twas all they knew, that lara was not there;\r","nor sent, nor came he, till conjecture grew\r","cold in the many, anxious in the few\r","his hall scarce echoes with his wonted name,\r","his portrait darkens in its fading frame,\r","another chief consoled his destined bride,\r","the young forgot him, and the old had died;\r","\"yet doth he live!\" exclaims the impatient heir,\r","and sighs for sables which he must not wear\r","a hundred scutcheons deck with gloomy grace\r","the laras' last and longest

need not guess;\r","they more might marvel, when the greeting's o'er,\r","not that he came, but came not long before:\r","no train is his beyond a single page,\r","of foreign aspect, and of tender age\r","years had roll'd on, and fast they speed away\r","to those that wander as to those that stay;\r","but lack of tidings from another clime\r","had lent a flagging wing to weary time\r","they see, they recognise, yet almost deem\r","the present dubious, or the past a dream\r","he lives, nor yet is past his manhood's prime,\r","though sear'd by toil, and something touch'd by time;\r","his faults, whate'er they were, if scarce forgot,\r","might be untaught him by his varied lot;\r","nor good nor ill of late were known, his name\r","might yet uphold his patrimonial fame\r","his soul in youth was haughty, but his sins\r","no more than pleasure from the stripling wins;\r","and such, if not yet harden'd in their course,\r","might be redeem'd, nor ask a long remorse\r"," \r","            v\r","and they indeed were changed — 'tis quickly seen,\r","whate'er he be, 'twas not what he had been:\r","that brow in furrow'd lines had fix'd at last,\r","and spake of passions, but of passion past;\r","the pride, but not the fire, of early days,\r","coldness of mien, and carelessness of praise;\r","a high demeanour, and a glance that took\r","their thoughts from others by a single look;\r","and that sarcastic levity of tongue,\r","the stinging of a heart the world hath stung,\r","that darts in seeming playfulness around,\r","and makes those feel that will not own the wound:\r","all these seem'd his, and something more beneath\r","than glance could well reveal, or accent breathe\r","ambition, glory, love, the common aim\r","that some can conquer, and that all would claim,\r","within his breast appear'd no more to strive,\r","yet seem'd as lately they had been alive;\r","and some deep feeling it were vain to trace\r","at moments lighten'd o'er his livid face\r","    vi\r","not much he loved long question of the past,\r","nor told of wondrous wilds, and deserts vast,\r","in those far lands where he had wander'd lone,\r","and — as himself would have it seem — unknown:\r","yet these in vain his eye could scarcely scan,\r","nor glean experience from his fellow-man;\r","but what he had beheld he shunn'd to show,\r","as hardly worth a stranger's care to know;\r","if still more prying such inquiry grew,\r","his brow fell darker, and his words more few\r","    v\r","not unrejoiced to see him once again,\r","warm was his welcome to the haunts of men;\r","born of high lineage, link'd in high command,\r","he mingled with the magnates of his land;\r","    \r","join'd the carousals of the great and gay,\r","and saw them smile or sigh their hours away;\r","but still he only saw, and did not share\r","the common pleasure or the general care;\r","he did not follow what they all pursued,\r","with hope still baffled, still to be renew'd;\r","nor shadowy honour, nor substantial gain,\r","nor beauty's preference, and the rival's pain:\r","around him some mysterious circle thrown\r","repell'd approach, and showed him still alone;\r","upon his eye sate something of reproof,\r","that kept at least frivolity aloof;\r","and things more timid that beheld him near,\r","in silence gazed, or whisper'd mutual fear;\r","and they the wiser, friendlier few confess'd\r","they deem'd him better than his air express'd\r","    vi\r","'twas strange — in youth all action and all life,\r","burning for pleasure, not averse from strife;\r","woman — the field — the ocean — all that gave\r","promise of gladness, peril of a grave,\r","in turn he tried — he ransack'd all below,\r","and found his recompence in joy or woe,\r","no tame, trite medium; for his feelings sought\r","in that intenseness an escape from thought:\r","the tempest of his heart in scorn had gazed\r","on that the feebler elements hath raised;\r","the rapture of his heart had look'd on high,\r","and ask'd if greater dwelt beyond the sky:\r","chain'd to excess, the slave of each extreme,\r","how woke he from the wildness of that dream?\r","alas! he told not — but he did awake\r","to curse the wither'd heart that would not break\r","    i\r","books, for his volume heretofore was man,\r","with eye more curious he appear'd to scan,\r","and oft, in sudden mood, for many a day\r","from all communion he would start away:\r","    \r","and then, his rarely call'd attendants said,\r","through night's long hours would sound his hurried tread\r","o'er the dark gallery, where his fathers frown'd\r","in rude but antique portraiture around\r","they heard, but whisper'd — \"that must not be known —\r","the sound of words less earthly than his own\r","yes, they who chose might smile, but some had seen\r","they scarce knew what, but more than should have been\r","why gazed he so upon the ghastly head\r","which hands profane had gather'd from the dead,\r","that still beside his open'd volume lay,\r","as if to startle all save him away?\r","why slept he not when others were at rest?\r","why heard no music, and received no guest?\r","all was not well, they deem'd — but where the wrong?\r","some knew perchance — but 'twere a tale too long;\r","and such besides were too discreetly wise,\r","to more than hint their knowledge in surmise;\r","but if they would — they could\" — around the board,\r","thus lara's vassals prattled of their lord\r","    \r","it was the night — and lara's glassy stream\r","the stars are studding, each with imaged beam:\r","so calm, the waters scarcely seem to stray,\r","and yet they glide like happiness away;\r","reflecting far and fairy-like from high\r","the immortal lights that live along the sky:\r","its banks are fringed with many a goodly tree,\r","and flowers the fairest that may feast the bee;\r","such in her chaplet infant dian wove,\r","and innocence would offer to her love\r","these deck the shore; the waves their channel make\r","in windings bright and mazy like the snake\r","all was so still, so soft in earth and air,\r","you scarce would start to meet a spirit there;\r","secure that nought of evil could delight\r","to walk in such a scene, on such a night!\r","it was a moment only for the good:\r","so lara deem'd, nor longer there he stood,\r","but turn'd in silence to his castle-gate;\r","    \r","such scene his soul no more could contemplate\r","such scene reminded him of other days,\r","of skies more cloudless, moons of purer blaze,\r","of nights more soft and frequent, hearts that now —\r","no — no — the storm may beat upon his brow,\r","unfelt — unsparing — but a night like this,\r","a night of beauty mock'd such breast as his\r","    xi\r","he turn'd within his solitary hall,\r","and his high shadow shot along the wall;\r","there were the painted forms of other times,\r","'twas all they left of virtues or of crimes,\r","save vague tradition; and the gloomy vaults\r","that hid their dust, their foibles, and their faults;\r","and half a column of the pompous page,\r","that speeds the specious tale from age to age:\r","when history's pen its praise or blame supplies,\r","and lies like truth, and still most truly lies\r","he wandering mused, and as the moonbeam shone\r","through the dim lattice o'er the floor of stone,\r","and the high fretted roof, and saints, that there\r","o'er gothic windows knelt in pictured prayer,\r","reflected in fantastic figures grew,\r","like life, but not like mortal life, to view;\r","his bristling locks of sable, brow of gloom,\r","and the wide waving of his shaken plume,\r","glanced like a spectre's attributes, and gave\r","his aspect all that terror gives the grave\r","    \r","'twas midnight — all was slumber; the lone light\r","dimm'd in the lamp, as loth to break the night\r","hark! there be murmurs heard in lara's hall —\r","a sound — voice — a shriek — a fearful call!\r","a long, loud shriek — and silence — did they hear\r","that frantic echo burst the sleeping ear?\r","they heard and rose, and tremulously brave\r","rush where the sound invoked their aid to save;\r","they come with half-lit tapers in their hands,\r"," \r","and snatch'd in startled haste unbelted brands\r","    xi\r","cold as the marble where his length was laid,\r","pale as the beam that o'er his features play'd,\r","was lara stretch'd; his half-drawn sabre near,\r","dropp'd it should seem in more than nature's fear;\r","yet he was firm, or had been firm till now,\r","and still defiance knit his gather'd brow;\r","though mix'd with terror, senseless as he lay,\r","there lived upon his lip the wish to slay;\r","some half-form'd threat in utterance there had died,\r","some imprecation of despairing pride;\r","his eye was almost seal'd, but not forsook\r","even in its trance the gladiator's look,\r","that oft awake his aspect could disclose,\r","and now was fix'd in horrible repose\r","they raise him — bear him: hush! he breathes, he speaks!\r","the swarthy blush recolours in his cheeks,\r","his lip resumes its red, his eye, though dim,\r","rolls wide and wild, each slowly quivering limb\r","recalls its function, but his words are strung\r","in terms that seem not of his native tongue;\r","distinct but strange, enough they understand\r","to deem them accents of another land,\r","and such they were, and meant to meet an ear\r","that hears him not — alas! that cannot hear!\r","    \r","his page approach'd, and he alone appear'd\r","to know the import of the words they heard;\r","and by the changes of his cheek and brow\r","they were not such as lara should avow,\r","nor he interpret, yet with less surprise\r","than those around their chieftain's state he eyes,\r","but lara's prostrate form he bent beside,\r","and in that tongue which seem'd his own replied,\r","and lara heeds those tones that gently seem\r","to soothe away the horrors of his dream;\r","if dream it were, that thus could overthrow\r","    \r","a breast that needed not ideal woe\r","    xv\r","whate'er his frenzy dream'd or eye beheld,\r","if yet remember'd ne'er to be reveal'd,\r","rests at his heart: the custom'd morning came,\r","and breathed new vigour in his shaking frame;\r","and solace sought he none from priest nor leech,\r","and soon the same in movement and in speech\r","as heretofore he fill'd the passing hours,\r","nor less he smiles, nor more his forehead lours\r","than these were wont; and if the coming night\r","appear'd less welcome now to lara's sight,\r","he to his marvelling vassals shew'd it not,\r","whose shuddering proved their fear was less forgot\r","in trembling pairs alone they dared not crawl\r","the astonish'd slaves, and shun the fated hall;\r","the waving banner, and the clapping door;\r","the rustling tapestry, and the echoing floor;\r","the long dim shadows of surrounding trees,\r","the flapping bat, the night song of the breeze;\r","aught they behold or hear their thought appals\r","as evening saddens o'er the dark gray walls\r","    xvi\r","vain thought! that hour of ne'er unravell'd gloom\r","came not again, or lara could assume\r","a seeming of forgetfulness that made\r","his vassals more amazed nor less afraid —\r","had memory vanish'd then with sense restored?\r","since word, nor look, nor gesture of their lord\r","betray'd a feeling that recall'd to these\r","that fever'd moment of his mind's disease\r","was it a dream? was his the voice that spoke\r","those strange wild accents; his the cry that broke\r","their slumber? his the oppress'd o'er-labour'd heart\r","that ceased to beat, the look that made them start?\r","could he who thus had suffer'd, so forget\r","when such as saw that suffering shudder yet?\r","or did that silence prove his memory fix'd\r","too deep for words, indelible, unmix'd\r","in that corroding secresy which gnaws\r","the heart to shew the effect, but not the cause?\r","not so in him; his breast had buried both,\r","nor common gazers could discern the growth\r","of thoughts that mortal lips must leave half told;\r","they choke the feeble words that would unfold\r","    xv\r","in him inexplicably mix'd appear'd\r","much to be loved and hated, sought and fear'd;\r","opinion varying o'er his hidden lot,\r","in praise or railing ne'er his name forgot;\r","his silence form'd a theme for others' prate —\r","they guess'd — they gazed — they fain would know his fate\r","what had he been? what was he, thus unknown,\r","who walk'd their world, his lineage only known?\r","a hater of his kind? yet some would say,\r","with them he could seem gay amidst the gay;\r","but own'd that smile, if oft observed and near,\r","waned in its mirth and wither'd to a sneer;\r","that smile might reach his lip, but pass'd not by,\r","none e'er could trace its laughter to his eye:\r","yet there was softness too in his regard,\r","at times, a heart as not by nature hard,\r","but once perceived, his spirit seem'd to chide\r","such weakness, as unworthy of its pride,\r","and steel'd itself, as scorning to redeem\r","one doubt from others' half withheld esteem;\r","in self-inflicted penance of a breast\r","which tenderness might once have wrung from rest;\r","in vigilance of grief that would compel\r","the soul to hate for having loved too well\r","    xvi\r","there was in him a vital scorn of all:\r","as if the worst had fall'n which could befall,\r","he stood a stranger in this breathing world,\r","an erring spirit from another hurled;\r","a thing of dark imaginings, that shaped\r","      \r","by choice the perils he by chance escaped;\r","but 'scaped in vain, for in their memory yet\r","his mind would half exult and half regret:\r","with more capacity for love than earth\r","bestows on most of mortal mould and birth,\r","his early dreams of good outstripp'd the truth,\r","and troubled manhood follow'd baffled youth;\r","with thought of years in phantom chase misspent,\r","and wasted powers for better purpose lent;\r","and fiery passions that had pour'd their wrath\r","in hurried desolation o'er his path,\r","and left the better feelings all at strife\r","in wild reflection o'er his stormy life;\r","but haughty still, and loth himself to blame,\r","he call'd on nature's self to share the shame,\r","and charged all faults upon the fleshly form\r","she gave to clog the soul, and feast the worm;\r","'till he at last confounded good and ill,\r","and half mistook for fate the acts of will:\r","too high for common selfishness, he could\r","at times resign his own for others' good,\r","but not in pity, not because he ought,\r","but in some strange perversity of thought,\r","that sway'd him onward with a secret pride\r","to do what few or none would do beside;\r","and this same impulse would, in tempting time,\r","mislead his spirit equally to crime;\r","so much he soar'd beyond, or sunk beneath\r","the men with whom he felt condemn'd to breathe,\r","and long'd by good or ill to separate\r","himself from all who shared his mortal state;\r","his mind abhorring this had fix'd her throne\r","far from the world, in regions of her own;\r","thus coldly passing all that pass'd below,\r","his blood in temperate seeming now would flow:\r","ah! happier if it ne'er with guilt had glow'd,\r","but ever in that icy smoothness flow'd:\r","'tis true, with other men their path he walk'd,\r","and like the rest in seeming did and talk'd,\r","nor outraged reason's rules by flaw nor start,\r","his madness was not of the head, but heart;\r","and rarely wander'd in his speech, or drew\r","   \r","his thoughts so forth as to offend the view\r","    xi\r","with all that chilling mystery of mien,\r","and seeming gladness to remain unseen,\r","he had if 'twere not nature's boon an art\r","of fixing memory on another's heart:\r","it was not love, perchance — nor hate — nor aught\r","that words can image to express the thought;\r","but they who saw him did not see in vain,\r","and once beheld, would ask of him again:\r","and those to whom he spake remember'd well,\r","and on the words, however light, would dwell\r","none knew nor how, nor why, but he entwined\r","himself perforce around the hearer's mind;\r","there he was stamp'd, in liking, or in hate,\r","if greeted once; however brief the date\r","that friendship, pity, or aversion knew,\r","still there within the inmost thought he grew\r","you could not penetrate his soul, but found\r","despite your wonder, to your own he wound\r","his presence haunted still; and from the breast\r","he forced an all-unwilling interest;\r","vain was the struggle in that mental net,\r","his spirit seem'd to dare you to forget!\r","    \r","there is a festival, where knights and dames,\r","and aught that wealth or lofty lineage claims,\r","appear — a high-born and a welcomed guest\r","to otho's hall came lara with the rest\r","the long carousal shakes the illumined hall,\r","well speeds alike the banquet and the ball;\r","and the gay dance of bounding beauty's train\r","links grace and harmony in happiest chain:\r","blest are the early hearts and gentle hands\r","that mingle there in well according bands;\r","it is a sight the careful brow might smooth,\r","and make age smile, and dream itself to youth,\r","and youth forget such hour was pass'd on earth,\r","    \r","so springs the exulting bosom to that mirth!\r","    \r","and lara gazed on these sedately glad,\r","his brow belied him if his soul was sad,\r","and his glance follow'd fast each fluttering fair,\r","whose steps of lightness woke no echo there:\r","he lean'd against the lofty pillar nigh\r","with folded arms and long attentive eye,\r","nor mark'd a glance so sternly fix'd on his,\r","ill brook'd high lara scrutiny like this:\r","at length he caught it, 'tis a face unknown,\r","but seems as searching his, and his alone;\r","prying and dark, a stranger's by his mien,\r","who still till now had gazed on him unseen;\r","at length encountering meets the mutual gaze\r","of keen inquiry, and of mute amaze;\r","on lara's glance emotion gathering grew,\r","as if distrusting that the stranger threw;\r","along the stranger's aspect fix'd and stern\r","flash'd more than thence the vulgar eye could learn\r","    \r","\"'tis he!\" the stranger cried, and those that heard\r","re-echo'd fast and far the whisper'd word\r","\"'tis he!\" — \"'tis who?\" they question far and near,\r","till louder accents rang on lara's ear;\r","so widely spread, few bosoms well could brook\r","the general marvel, or that single look;\r","but lara stirr'd not, changed not, the surprise\r","that sprung at first to his arrested eyes\r","seem'd now subsided, neither sunk nor raised\r","glanced his eye round, though still the stranger gazed;\r","and drawing nigh, exclaim'd, with haughty sneer,\r","\"'tis he! — how came he thence? — what doth he here?\"\r","    \r","it were too much for lara to pass by\r","such question, so repeated fierce and high;\r","   \r","with look collected, but with accent cold,\r","more mildly firm than petulantly bold,\r","he turn'd, and met the inquisitorial tone —\r","\"my name is lara! — when thine own is known,\r","doubt not my fitting answer to requite\r","the unlook'd for courtesy of such a knight\r","'tis lara! — further wouldst thou mark or ask?\r","i shun no question, and i wear no mask\"\r","\"thou shunn'st no question! ponder — is there none\r","thy heart must answer, though thine ear would shun?\r","and deem'st thou me unknown too? gaze again!\r","at least thy memory was not given in vain\r","oh! never canst thou cancel half her debt,\r","eternity forbids thee to forget\"\r","with slow and searching glance upon his face\r","grew lara's eyes, but nothing there could trace\r","they knew, or chose to know — with dubious look\r","he deign'd no answer, but his head he shook,\r","and half contemptuous turn'd to pass away;\r","but the stern stranger motion'd him to stay\r","\"a word! — i charge thee stay, and answer here\r","to one, who, wert thou noble, were thy peer,\r","but as thou wast and art — nay, frown not, lord,\r","if false, 'tis easy to disprove the word —\r","but as thou wast and art, on thee looks down,\r","distrusts thy smiles, but shakes not at thy frown\r","art thou not he? whose deeds — \"\r","                \"whate'er i be,\r","words wild as these, accusers like to thee,\r","i list no further; those with whom they weigh\r","may hear the rest, nor venture to gainsay\r","the wondrous tale no doubt thy tongue can tell,\r","which thus begins courteously and well\r","let otho cherish here his polish'd guest,\r","to him my thanks and thoughts shall be express'd\"\r","and here their wondering host hath interposed —\r","\"whate'er there be between you undisclosed,\r","this is no time nor fitting place to mar\r","the mirthful meeting with a wordy war\r","if thou, sir ezzelin, hast ought to show\r","which it befits count lara's ear to know,\r","to-morrow, here, or elsewhere, as may best\r","beseem your mutual judgment, speak the rest;\r","i pledge myself for thee, as not unknown,\r","though, like count lara, now return'd alone\r","from other lands, almost a stranger grown;\r","and if from lara's blood and gentle birth\r","i augur right of courage and of worth,\r","he will not that untainted line belie,\r","nor aught that knighthood may accord deny\"\r","\"to-morrow be it,\" ezzelin replied,\r","\"and here our several worth and truth be tried:\r","i gage my life, my falchion to attest\r","my words, so may i mingle with the blest!\"\r","what answers lara? to its centre shrunk\r","his soul, in deep abstraction sudden sunk;\r","the words of many, and the eyes of all\r","that there were gather'd, seem'd on him to fall;\r","but his were silent, his appear'd to stray\r","in far forgetfulness away — away —\r","alas! that heedlessness of all around\r","bespoke remembrance only too profound\r","    \r","\"to-morrow! — ay, to-morrow!\" — further word\r","than those repeated none from lara heard;\r","upon his brow no outward passion spoke,\r","from his large eye no flashing anger broke;\r","yet there was something fix'd in that low tone\r","which shew'd resoe, determined, though unknown\r","he seized his cloak — his head he slightly bow'd,\r","and passing ezzelin he left the crowd;\r","and as he pass'd him, smiling met the frown\r","with which that chieftain's brow would bear him down:\r","it was nor smile of mirth, nor struggling pride\r","that curbs to scorn the wrath it cannot hide;\r","but that of one in his own heart secure\r","of all that he would do, or could endure\r","could this mean peace? the calmness of the good?\r","or guilt grown old in desperate hardihood?\r","alas! too like in confidence are each\r"," \r","for man to trust to mortal look or speech;\r","from deeds, and deeds alone, may he discern\r","truths which it wrings the unpractised heart to learn\r","    \r","and lara call'd his page, and went his way —\r","well could that stripling word or sign obey:\r","his only follower from those climes afar\r","where the soul glows beneath a brighter star;\r","for lara left the shore from whence he sprung,\r","in duty patient, and sedate though young;\r","silent as him he served, his fate appears\r","above his station, and beyond his years\r","though not unknown the tongue of lara's land,\r","in such from him he rarely heard command;\r","but fleet his step, and clear his tones would come,\r","when lara's lip breathed forth the words of home:\r","those accents, as his native mountains dear,\r","awake their absent echoes in his ear,\r","friends', kindreds', parents', wonted voice recall,\r","now lost, abjured, for one — his friend, his all:\r","for him earth now disclosed no other guide;\r","what marvel then he rarely left his side?\r","    \r","light was his form, and darkly delicate\r","that brow whereon his native sun had sate,\r","but had not marr'd, though in his beams he grew,\r","the cheek where oft the unbidden blush shone through;\r","yet not such blush as mounts when health would show\r","all the heart's hue in that delighted glow;\r","but 'twas a hectic tint of secret care\r","that for a burning moment fever'd there;\r","and the wild sparkle of his eye seem'd caught\r","from high, and lighten'd with electric thought,\r","though its black orb those long low lashes' fringe\r","had temper'd with a melancholy tinge;\r","yet less of sorrow than of pride was there,\r","or, if 'twere grief, a grief that none should share:\r","and pleased not him the sports that please his age,\r","  \r","the tricks of youth, the frolics of the page;\r","for hours on lara he would fix his glance,\r","as all-forgotten in that watchful trance;\r","and from his chief withdrawn, he wander'd lone,\r","brief were his answers, and his questions none;\r","his walk the wood, his sport some foreign book;\r","his resting-place the bank that curbs the brook;\r","he seem'd, like him he served, to live apart\r","from all that lures the eye, and fills the heart;\r","to know no brotherhood; and take from earth\r","no gift beyond that bitter boon — our birth\r","    \r","if aught he loved, 'twas lara; but was shown\r","his faith in reverence and in deeds alone;\r","in mute attention; and his care, which guess'd\r","each wish, fulfill'd it ere the tongue express'd\r","still there was haughtiness in all he did,\r","a spirit deep that brook'd not to be chid;\r","his zeal, though more than that of servile hands,\r","in act alone obeys, his air commands;\r","as if 'twas lara's less than his desire\r","that thus he served, but surely not for hire\r","slight were the tasks enjoin'd him by his lord,\r","to hold the stirrup, or to bear the sword;\r","to tune his lute, or, if he will'd it more,\r","on tomes of other times and tongues to pore;\r","but ne'er to mingle with the menial train,\r","to whom he shew'd not deference nor disdain,\r","but that well-worn reserve which proved he knew\r","no sympathy with that familiar crew:\r","his soul, whate'er his station or his stem,\r","could bow to lara, not descend to them\r","of higher birth he seem'd, and better days,\r","nor mark of vulgar toil that hand betrays,\r","so femininely white it might bespeak\r","another sex, when match'd with that smooth cheek,\r","but for his garb, and something in his gaze,\r","more wild and high than woman's eye betrays;\r","a latent fierceness that far more became\r","his fiery climate than his tender frame:\r","    \r","true, in his words it broke not from his breast,\r","but from his aspect might be more than guess'd\r","kaled his name, though rumour said he bore\r","another ere he left his mountain shore;\r","for sometimes he would hear, however nigh,\r","that name repeated loud without reply,\r","as unfamiliar, or, if roused again,\r","start to the sound, as but remember'd then;\r","unless 'twas lara's wonted voice that spake,\r","for then, ear, eyes, and heart would all awake\r","    \r","he had look'd down upon the festive hall,\r","and mark'd that sudden strife so mark'd of all;\r","and when the crowd around and near him told\r","their wonder at the calmness of the bold,\r","their marvel how the high-born lara bore\r","such insult from a stranger, doubly sore,\r","the colour of young kaled went and came,\r","the lip of ashes, and the cheek of flame;\r","and o'er his brow the dampening heart-drops threw\r","the sickening iciness of that cold dew\r","that rises as the busy bosom sinks\r","with heavy thoughts from which reflection shrinks\r","yes — there be things which we must dream and dare\r","and execute ere thought be half aware:\r","whate'er might kaled's be, it was enow\r","to seal his lip, but agonise his brow\r","he gazed on ezzelin till lara cast\r","that sidelong smile upon on the knight he pass'd;\r","when kaled saw that smile his visage fell,\r","as if on something recognised right well;\r","his memory read in such a meaning more\r","than lara's aspect unto others wore\r","forward he sprung — a moment, both were gone,\r","and all within that hall seem'd left alone;\r","each had so fix'd his eye on lara's mien,\r","all had so mix'd their feelings with that scene,\r","that when his long dark shadow through the porch\r","no more relieves the glare of yon high torch,\r","each pulse beats quicker, and all bosoms seem\r","     \r","to bound as doubting from too black a dream,\r","such as we know is false, yet dread in sooth,\r","because the worst is ever nearest truth\r","and they are gone — but ezzelin is there,\r","with thoughtful visage and imperious air;\r","but long remain'd not; ere an hour expired\r","he waved his hand to otho, and retired\r","    \r","the crowd are gone, the revellers at rest;\r","the courteous host, and all-approving guest,\r","again to that accustom'd couch must creep\r","where joy subsides, and sorrow sighs to sleep,\r","and man, o'erlabour'd with his being's strife,\r","shrinks to that sweet forgetfulness of life:\r","there lie love's feverish hope and cunning's guile,\r","hate's working brain and lull'd ambition's wile;\r","o'er each vain eye oblivion's pinions wave,\r","and quench'd existence crouches in a grave\r","what better name may slumber's bed become?\r","night's sepulchre, the universal home,\r","where weakness, strength, vice, virtue, sunk supine,\r","alike in naked helplessness recline;\r","glad for awhile to heave unconscious breath,\r","yet wake to wrestle with the dread of death,\r","and shun, though day but dawn on ills increased,\r","that sleep, the loveliest, since it dreams the least\r","canto the second\r","night wanes — the vapours round the mountains curl'd,\r","melt into morn, and light awakes the world\r","man has another day to swell the past,\r","and lead him near to little, but his last;\r","but mighty nature bounds as from her birth,\r","the sun is in the heavens, and life on earth;\r","flowers in the valley, splendour in the beam,\r"," \r","health on the gale, and freshness in the stream\r","immortal man! behold her glories shine,\r","and cry, exulting inly, \"they are thine!\"\r","gaze on, while yet thy gladden'd eye may see,\r","a morrow comes when they are not for thee;\r","and grieve what may above thy senseless bier,\r","nor earth nor sky will yield a single tear;\r","nor cloud shall gather more, nor leaf shall fall,\r","nor gale breathe forth one sigh for thee, for all;\r","but creeping things shall revel in their spoil,\r","and fit thy clay to fertilise the soil\r","    \r","'tis morn — 'tis noon — assembled in the hall,\r","the gather'd chieftains come to otho's call:\r","'tis now the promised hour, that must proclaim\r","the life or death of lara's future fame;\r","when ezzelin his charge may here unfold,\r","and whatsoe'er the tale, it must be told\r","his faith was pledged, and lara's promise given,\r","to meet it in the eye of man and heaven\r","why comes he not? such truths to be divulged,\r","methinks the accuser's rest is long indulged\r","    i\r","the hour is past, and lara too is there,\r","with self-confiding, coldly patient air;\r","why comes not ezzelin? the hour is past,\r","and murmurs rise, and otho's brow's o'ercast,\r","\"i know my friend! his faith i cannot fear,\r","if yet he be on earth, expect him here;\r","the roof that held him in the valley stands\r","between my own and noble lara's lands;\r","my halls from such a guest had honour gain'd,\r","nor had sir ezzelin his host disdain'd,\r","but that some previous proof forbade his stay,\r","and urged him to prepare against to-day;\r","the word i pledge for his i pledge again,\r","or will myself redeem his knighthood's stain\"\r","     \r","he ceased — and lara answer'd, \"i am here\r","to lend at thy demand a listening ear,\r","to tales of evil from a stranger's tongue,\r","whose words already might my heart have wrung,\r","but that i deem'd him scarcely less than mad,\r","or, at the worst, a foe ignobly bad\r","i know him not — but me it seems he knew\r","in lands where — but i must not trifle too:\r","produce this babbler — or redeem the pledge;\r","here in thy hold, and with thy falchion's edge\"\r","proud otho on the instant, reddening, threw\r","his glove on earth, and forth his sabre flew\r","\"the last alternative befits me best,\r","and thus i answer for mine absent guest\"\r","with cheek unchanging from its sallow gloom,\r","however near his own or other's tomb;\r","with hand, whose almost careless coolness spoke\r","its grasp well-used to deal the sabre-stroke;\r","with eye, though calm, determined not to spare,\r","did lara too his willing weapon bare\r","in vain the circling chieftains round them closed,\r","for otho's frenzy would not be opposed;\r","and from his lip those words of insult fell —\r","his sword is good who can maintain them well\r","    \r","short was the conflict; furious, blindly rash,\r","vain otho gave his bosom to the gash:\r","he bled, and fell; but not with deadly wound,\r","stretch'd by a dextrous sleight along the ground\r","\"demand thy life!\" he answer'd not: and then\r","from that red floor he ne'er had risen again,\r","for lara's brow upon the moment grew\r","almost to blackness in its demon hue;\r","and fiercer shook his angry falchion now\r","than when his foe's was levell'd at his brow;\r","then all was stern collectedness and art,\r","now rose the unleaven'd hatred of his heart;\r","so little sparing to the foe he fell'd,\r","     \r","that when the approaching crowd his arm withheld\r","he almost turn'd the thirsty point on those\r","who thus for mercy dared to interpose;\r","but to a moment's thought that purpose bent;\r","yet look'd he on him still with eye intent,\r","as if he loathed the ineffectual strife\r","that left a foe, howe'er o'erthrown, with life;\r","as if to search how far the wound he gave\r","had sent its victim onward to his grave\r","    v\r","they raised the bleeding otho, and the leech\r","forbade all present question, sign, and speech;\r","the others met within a neighbouring hall,\r","and he, incensed and heedless of them all,\r","the cause and conqueror in this sudden fray,\r","in haughty silence slowly strode away;\r","he back'd his steed, his homeward path he took,\r","nor cast on otho's tower a single look\r","    vi\r","but where was he? that meteor of a night,\r","who menaced but to disappear with light\r","where was this ezzelin? who came and went\r","to leave no other trace of his intent\r","he left the dome of otho long ere morn,\r","in darkness, yet so well the path was worn\r","he could not miss it: near his dwelling lay;\r","but there he was not, and with coming day\r","came fast inquiry, which unfolded nought\r","except the absence of the chief it sought\r","a chamber tenantless, a steed at rest,\r","his host alarm'd, his murmuring squires distress'd:\r","their search extends along, around the path,\r","in dread to met the marks of prowlers' wrath:\r","but none are there, and not a brake hath borne\r","nor gout of blood, nor shred of mantle torn;\r","nor fall nor struggle hath defaced the grass,\r","which still retains a mark where murder was;\r","nor dabbling fingers left to tell the tale,\r","the bitter print of each convulsive nail,\r","when agonised hands that cease to guard,\r","wound in that pang the smoothness of the sward\r","some such had been, if here a life was reft,\r","but these were not; and doubting hope is left;\r","and strange suspicion, whispering lara's name,\r","now daily mutters o'er his blacken'd fame;\r","then sudden silent when his form appear'd,\r","awaits the absence of the thing it fear'd;\r","again its wonted wondering to renew,\r","and dye conjecture with a darker hue\r","    v\r","days roll along, and otho's wounds are heal'd,\r","but not his pride; and hate no more conceal'd:\r","he was a man of power, and lara's foe,\r","the friend of all who sought to work him woe,\r","and from his country's justice now demands\r","account of ezzelin at lara's hands\r","who else than lara could have cause to fear\r","his presence? who had made him disappear,\r","if not the man on whom his menaced charge\r","had sate too deeply were he left at large?\r","the general rumour ignorantly loud,\r","the mystery dearest to the curious crowd;\r","the seeming friendlessness of him who strove\r","to win no confidence, and wake no love;\r","the sweeping fierceness which his soul betray'd,\r","the skill with which he wielded his keen blade;\r","where had his arm unwarlike caught that art?\r","where had that fierceness grown upon his heart?\r","for it was not the blind capricious rage\r","a word can kindle and a word assuage;\r","but the deep working of a soul unmix'd\r","with aught of pity where its wrath had fix'd;\r","such as long power and overgorged success\r","concentrates into all that's merciless:\r","these, link'd with that desire which ever sways\r","mankind, the rather to condemn than praise,\r","'gainst lara gathering raised at length a storm,\r","such as himself might fear, and foes would form,\r","   \r","and he must answer for the absent head\r","of one that haunts him still, alive or dead\r","    vi\r","within that land was many a malcontent,\r","who cursed the tyranny to which he bent;\r","that soil full many a wringing despot saw,\r","who work'd his wantonness in form of law;\r","long war without and frequent broil within\r","had made a path for blood and giant sin,\r","that waited but a signal to begin\r","new havoc, such as civil discord blends,\r","which knows no neuter, owns but foes or friends;\r","fix'd in his feudal fortress each was lord,\r","in word and deed obey'd, in soul abhorr'd\r","thus lara had inherited his lands,\r","and with them pining hearts and sluggish hands;\r","but that long absence from his native clime\r","had left him stainless of oppression's crime,\r","and now, diverted by his milder sway,\r","all dread by slow degrees had worn away;\r","the menials felt their usual awe alone,\r","but more for him than them that fear was grown;\r","they deem'd him now unhappy, though at first\r","their evil judgment augur'd of the worst,\r","and each long restless night, and silent mood,\r","was traced to sickness, fed by solitude:\r","and though his lonely habits threw of late\r","gloom o'er his chamber, cheerful was his gate;\r","for thence the wretched ne'er unsoothed withdrew,\r","for them, at least, his soul compassion knew\r","cold to the great, contemptuous to the high,\r","the humble pass'd not his unheeding eye;\r","much he would speak not, but beneath his roof\r","they found asylum oft, and ne'er reproof\r","and they who watch'd might mark that, day by day,\r","some new retainers gather'd to his sway;\r","but most of late, since ezzelin was lost,\r","he play'd the courteous lord and bounteous host:\r","perchance his strife with otho made him dread\r","some snare prepared for his obnoxious head;\r","    \r","whate'er his view, his favour more obtains\r","with these, the people, than his fellow thanes\r","if this were policy, so far 'twas sound,\r","the million judged but of him as they found;\r","from him by sterner chiefs to exile driven\r","they but required a shelter, and 'twas given\r","by him no peasant mourn'd his rifled cot,\r","and scarce the serf could murmur o'er his lot;\r","with him old avarice found its hoard secure,\r","with him contempt forbore to mock the poor;\r","youth present cheer and promised recompense\r","detain'd, till all too late to part from thence:\r","to hate he offer'd, with the coming change,\r","the deep reversion of delay'd revenge;\r","to love, long baffled by the unequal match,\r","the well-won charms success was sure to snatch\r","all now was ripe, he waits but to proclaim\r","that slavery nothing which was still a name\r","the moment came, the hour when otho thought\r","secure at last the vengeance which he sought\r","his summons found the destined criminal\r","begirt by thousands in his swarming hall,\r","fresh from their feudal fetters newly riven,\r","defying earth, and confident of heaven\r","that morning he had freed the soil-bound slaves\r","who dig no land for tyrants but their graves!\r","such is their cry — some watchword for the fight\r","must vindicate the wrong, and warp the right;\r","religion — freedom — vengeance — what you will,\r","a word's enough to raise mankind to kill;\r","some factious phrase by cunning caught and spread,\r","that guilt may reign, and woes and worms be fed!\r","    i\r","throughout that clime the feudal chiefs had gain'd\r","such sway, their infant monarch hardly reign'd;\r","now was the hour for faction's rebel growth,\r","the serfs contemn'd the one, and hated both:\r","they waited but a leader, and they found\r","one to their cause inseparably bound;\r","by circumstance compell'd to plunge again,\r","     \r","in self-defence, amidst the strife of men\r","cut off by some mysterious fate from those\r","whom birth and nature meant not for his foes,\r","had lara from that night, to him accurst,\r","prepared to meet, but not alone, the worst:\r","some reason urged, whate'er it was, to shun\r","inquiry into deeds at distance done;\r","by mingling with his own the cause of all,\r","e'en if he fail'd, he still delay'd his fall\r","the sullen calm that long his bosom kept,\r","the storm that once had spent itself and slept,\r","roused by events that seem'd foredoom'd to urge\r","his gloomy fortunes to their utmost verge,\r","burst forth, and made him all he once had been,\r","and is again; he only changed the scene\r","light care had he for life, and less for fame,\r","but not less fitted for the desperate game:\r","he deem'd himself mark'd out for others' hate,\r","and mock'd at ruin, so they shared his fate\r","what cared he for the freedom of the crowd?\r","he raised the humble but to bend the proud\r","he had hoped quiet in his sullen lair,\r","but man and destiny beset him there:\r","inured to hunters, he was found at bay;\r","and they must kill, they cannot snare the prey\r","stern, unambitious, silent he had been\r","henceforth a calm spectator of life's scene;\r","but dragg'd again upon the arena, stood\r","a leader not unequal to the feud;\r","in voice — mien — gesture — savage nature spoke,\r","and from his eye the gladiator broke\r","    \r","what boots the oft-repeated tale of strife,\r","the feast of vultures, and the waste of life?\r","the varying fortune of each separate field,\r","the fierce that vanquish, and the faint that yield?\r","the smoking ruin, and the crumbled wall?\r","in this the struggle was the same with all;\r","save that distemper'd passions lent their force\r","in bitterness that banish'd all remorse\r","none sued, for mercy know her cry was vain,\r","the captive died upon the battle-slain:\r","in either cause, one rage alone possess'd\r","the empire of the alternate victor's breast;\r","and they that smote for freedom or for sway,\r","deem'd few were slain, while more remain'd to slay\r","it was too late to check the wasting brand,\r","and desolation reap'd the famish'd land;\r","the torch was lighted, and the flame was spread,\r","and carnage smiled upon her daily bread\r","    xi\r","fresh with the nerve the new-born impulse strung,\r","the first success to lara's numbers clung:\r","but that vain victory hath ruin'd all;\r","they form no longer to their leader's call:\r","in blind confusion on the foe they press,\r","and think to snatch is to secure success\r","the lust of booty, and the thirst of hate,\r","lure on the broken brigands to their fate:\r","in vain he doth whate'er a chief may do,\r","to check the headlong fury of that crew,\r","in vain their stubborn ardour he would tame,\r","the hand that kindles cannot quench the flame\r","the wary foe alone hath turn'd their mood,\r","and shewn their rashness to that erring brood:\r","the feign'd retreat, the nightly ambuscade,\r","the daily harass, and the fight delay'd,\r","the long privation of the hoped supply,\r","the tentless rest beneath the humid sky,\r","the stubborn wall that mocks the leaguer's art,\r","and palls the patience of his baffled heart,\r","of these they had not deem'd: the battle-day\r","they could encounter as a veteran may;\r","but more preferr'd the fury of the strife,\r","and present death, to hourly suffering life:\r","and famine wrings, and fever sweeps away\r","his numbers melting fast from their array;\r","intemperate triumph fades to discontent,\r","and lara's soul alone seems still unbent:\r","but few remain to aid his voice and hand,\r","and thousands dwindled to a scanty band:\r","desperate, though few, the last and best remain'd\r","to mourn the discipline they late disdain'd\r","one hope survives, the frontier is not far,\r","and thence they may escape from native war;\r","and bear within them to the neighbouring state\r","an exile's sorrows, or an outlaw's hate:\r","hard is the task their fatherland to quit,\r","but harder still to perish or submit\r","    \r","it is resoed — they march — consenting night\r","guides with her star their dim and torchless flight;\r","already they perceive its tranquil beam\r","sleep on the surface of the barrier stream;\r","already they descry — is yon the bank?\r","away! 'tis lined with many a hostile rank\r","return or fly! — what glitters in the rear?\r","'tis otho's banner — the pursuer's spear!\r","are those the shepherds' fires upon the height?\r","alas! they blaze too widely for the flight:\r","cut off from hope, and compass'd in the toil,\r","less blood, perchance, hath bought a richer spoil!\r","    xi\r","a moment's pause — 'tis but to breathe their band\r","or shall they onward press, or here withstand?\r","it matters little — if they charge the foes\r","who by their border-stream their march oppose,\r","some few, perchance, may break and pass the line,\r","however link'd to baffle such design\r","\"the charge be ours! to wait for their assault\r","were fate well worthy of a coward's halt\"\r","forth flies each sabre, rein'd is every steed,\r","and the next word shall scarce outstrip the deed:\r","in the next tone of lara's gathering breath\r","how many shall but hear the voice of death!\r","    \r","his blade is bared — in him there is an air\r","as deep, but far too tranquil for despair;\r","a something of indifference more than then\r","becomes the bravest, if they feel for men\r","he turn'd his eye on kaled, ever near,\r","and still too faithful to betray one fear;\r","perchance 'twas but the moon's dim twilight threw\r","along his aspect an unwonted hue\r","of mournful paleness, whose deep tint express'd\r","the truth, and not the terror of his breast\r","this lara mark'd, and laid his hand on his:\r","it trembled not in such an hour as this;\r","his lip was silent, scarcely beat his heart,\r","his eye alone proclaim'd —\r","            \"we will not part!\r","thy band may perish, or thy friends may flee,\r","farewell to life, but not adieu to thee!\"\r","the word hath pass'd his lips, and onward driven,\r","pours the link'd band through ranks asunder riven;\r","well has each steed obey'd the armed heel,\r","and flash the scimitars, and rings the steel;\r","outnumber'd, not outbraved, they still oppose\r","despair to daring, and a front to foes;\r","and blood is mingled with the dashing stream,\r","which runs all redly till the morning beam\r","    xv\r","commanding, aiding, animating all,\r","where foe appear'd to press, or friend to fall,\r","cheers lara's voice, and waves or strikes his steel,\r","inspiring hope himself had ceased to feel\r","none fled, for well they knew that flight were vain,\r","but those that waver turn to smite again,\r","while yet they find the firmest of the foe\r","recoil before their leader's look and blow;\r","now girt with numbers, now almost alone,\r","he foils their ranks, or reunites his own;\r","himself he spared not — once they seem'd to fly —\r","now was the time, he waved his hand on high,\r","and shook — why sudden droops that plumed crest?\r","the shaft is sped — the arrow's in his breast!\r","that fatal gesture left the unguarded side,\r","and death hath stricken down yon arm of pride\r","the word of triumph fainted from his tongue;\r","that hand, so raised, how droopingly it hung!\r","but yet the sword instinctively retains,\r","though from its fellow shrink the falling reins;\r","these kaled snatches: dizzy with the blow,\r","and senseless bending o'er his saddle-bow\r","perceives not lara that his anxious page\r","beguiles his charger from the combat's rage:\r","meantime his followers charge and charge again;\r","too mix'd the slayers now to heed the slain!\r","    xvi\r","day glimmers on the dying and the dead,\r","the cloven cuirass, and the helmless head;\r","the war-horse masterless is on the earth,\r","and that last gasp hath burst his bloody girth:\r","and near, yet quivering with what life remain'd,\r","the heel that urged him, and the hand that rein'd:\r","and some too near that rolling torrent lie,\r","whose waters mock the lip of those that die;\r","that panting thirst which scorches in the breath\r","of those that die the soldier's fiery death,\r","in vain impels the burning mouth to crave\r","one drop — the last — to cool it for the grave;\r","with feeble and convulsive effort swept\r","their limbs along the crimson'd turf have crept:\r","the faint remains of life such struggles waste,\r","but yet they reach the stream, and bend to taste:\r","they feel its freshness, and almost partake —\r","why pause? — no further thirst have they to slake —\r","it is unquench'd, and yet they feel it not —\r","it was an agony — but now forgot!\r","    xv\r","beneath a lime, remoter from the scene,\r","where but for him that strife had never been,\r","a breathing but devoted warrior lay:\r","'twas lara bleeding fast from life away\r","his follower once, and now his only guide,\r","kneels kaled watchful o'er his welling side,\r","and with his scarf would stanch the tides that rush\r","with each convulsion in a blacker gush;\r","and then, as his faint breathing waxes low,\r","in feebler, not less fatal tricklings flow:\r","he scarce can speak, but motions him 'tis vain,\r","and merely adds another throb to pain\r","he clasps the hand that pang which would assuage,\r","and sadly smiles his thanks to that dark page,\r","who nothing fears, nor feels, nor heeds, nor sees,\r","save that damp brow which rests upon his knees;\r","save that pale aspect, where the eye, though dim,\r","held all the light that shone on earth for him\r","    xvi\r","the foe arrives, who long had search'd the field,\r","their triumph nought till lara too should yield;\r","they would remove him, but they see 'twere vain,\r","and he regards them with a calm disdain,\r","that rose to reconcile him with his fate,\r","and that escape to death from living hate:\r","and otho comes, and leaping from his steed,\r","looks on the bleeding foe that made him bleed,\r","and questions of his state; he answers not,\r","scarce glances on him as on one forgot,\r","and turns to kaled: — each remaining word,\r","they understood not, if distinctly heard;\r","his dying tones are in that other tongue,\r","to which some strange remembrance wildly clung\r","they spake of other scenes, but what — is known\r","to kaled, whom their meaning reach'd alone;\r","and he replied, though faintly, to their sound,\r","while gazed the rest in dumb amazement round:\r","they seem'd even then — that twain — unto the last\r","to half forget the present in the past;\r","to share between themsees some separate fate,\r","whose darkness none beside should penetrate\r","    xi\r","their words though faint were many — from the tone\r","their import those who heard could judge alone;\r","from this, you might have deem'd young kaled's death\r","more near than lara's by his voice and breath,\r","so sad, so deep, and hesitating broke\r","the accents his scarce-moving pale lips spoke;\r","but lara's voice, though low, at first was clear\r","and calm, till murmuring death gasp'd hoarsely near:\r","but from his visage little could we guess,\r","so unrepentant, dark, and passionless,\r","save that when struggling nearer to his last,\r","upon that page his eye was kindly cast;\r","and once, as kaled's answering accents ceased,\r","rose lara's hand, and pointed to the east:\r","whether as then the breaking sun from high\r","roll'd back the clouds the morrow caught his eye,\r","or that 'twas chance, or some remember'd scene\r","that raised his arm to point where such had been,\r","scarce kaled seem'd to know, but turn'd away,\r","as if his heart abhorr'd that coming day,\r","and shrunk his glance before that morning light\r","to look on lara's brow — where all grew night\r","yet sense seem'd left, though better were its loss;\r","for when one near display'd the absoing cross,\r","and proffer'd to his touch the holy bead,\r","of which his parting soul might own the need,\r","he look'd upon it with an eye profane,\r","and smiled — heaven pardon! if 'twere with disdain;\r","and kaled, though he spoke not, nor withdrew\r","from lara's face his fix'd despairing view,\r","with brow repulsive, and with gesture swift,\r","flung back the hand which held the sacred gift,\r","as if such but disturb'd the expiring man,\r","nor seem'd to know his life but then began,\r","the life immortal infinite, secure,\r","to all for whom that cross hath made it sure!\r","    \r","but gasping heaved the breath that lara drew,\r","and dull the film along his dim eye grew;\r","his limbs stretch'd fluttering, and his head droop'd o'er\r","the weak yet still untiring knee that bore:\r","he press'd the hand he held upon his heart —\r","it beats no more, but kaled will not part\r","with the cold grasp, but feels, and feels in vain,\r","for that faint throb which answers not again\r","\"it beats!\" — away, thou dreamer! he is gone —\r","it once was lara which thou look'st upon\r","    \r","he gazed, as if not yet had pass'd away\r","the haughty spirit of that humble clay;\r","and those around have roused him from his trance,\r","but cannot tear from thence his fixed glance;\r","and when in raising him from where he bore\r","within his arms the form that felt no more,\r","he saw the head his breast would still sustain,\r","roll down like earth to earth upon the plain;\r","he did not dash himself thereby, nor tear\r","the glossy tendrils of his raven hair,\r","but strove to stand and gaze, but reel'd and fell,\r","scarce breathing more than that he loved so well\r","than that he lov'd! oh! never yet beneath\r","the breast of man such trusty love may breathe!\r","that trying moment hath at once reveal'd\r","the secret long and yet but half conceal'd;\r","in baring to revive that lifeless breast,\r","its grief seem'd ended, but the sex confess'd;\r","and life return'd, and kaled felt no shame —\r","what now to her was womanhood or fame?\r","    \r","and lara sleeps not where his fathers sleep,\r","but where he died his grave was dug as deep;\r","nor is his mortal slumber less profound,\r","though priest nor bless'd, nor marble

that bought his children's food,\r","pass'd by the river that divides the plain\r","of otho's lands and lara's broad domain:\r","he heard a tramp — a horse and horseman broke\r","from out the wood — before him was a cloak\r","wrapt round some burthen at his saddle-bow,\r","bent was his head, and hidden was his brow\r","roused by the sudden sight at such a time,\r","and some foreboding that it might be crime,\r","     \r","himself unheeded watch'd the stranger's course,\r","who reach'd the river, bounded from his horse,\r","and lifting thence the burthen which he bore,\r","heaved up the bank, and dash'd it from the shore, \r","then paused, and look'd, and turn'd, and seem'd to watch,\r","and still another hurried glance would snatch,\r","and follow with his step the stream that flow'd,\r","as if even yet too much its surface show'd:\r","at once he started, stoop'd, around him strewn\r","the winter floods had scatter'd heaps of stone;\r","of these the heaviest thence he gather'd there,\r","and slung them with a more than common care\r","meantime the serf had crept to where unseen\r","himself might safely mark what this might mean\r","he caught a glimpse, as of a floating breast,\r","and something glitter'd starlike on the vest,\r","but ere he well could mark the buoyant trunk,\r","a massy fragment smote it, and it sunk:\r","it rose again, but indistinct to view,\r","and left the waters of a purple hue,\r","then deeply disappear'd: the horseman gazed\r","till ebb'd the latest eddy it had raised;\r","then turning, vaulted on his pawing steed,\r","and

would sit beneath the very tree,\r","where lay his drooping head upon her knee;\r","and in that posture where she saw him fall,\r","his words, his looks, his dying grasp recall;\r","and she had shorn,

the death, or\r","rather burial, of the duke of gandia the most interesting and particular account\r","of it is given by burchard, and is in substance as follows: — \"on the eighth day\r","of june, the cardinal of valenza and the duke of gandia, sons of the pope,\r","supped with their mother, vanozza, near the church of s pietro ad vincula;\r","several other persons being present at the entertainment a late hour\r","approaching, and the cardinal having reminded his brother, that it was time to\r","return to the apostolic palace, they mounted their horses or mules, with only a\r","few attendants, and proceeded together as far as the palace of cardinal ascanio\r","sforza, when the duke informed the cardinal that, before he returned home, he\r","had to pay a visit of pleasure dismissing therefore all his attendants, excepting\r","his staffiero, or footman, and a person in a mask, who had paid him a visit whilst\r","at supper, and who, during the space of a month, or thereabouts, previous to\r","this time, had called upon him almost daily at the apostolic palace, he took this\r","person behind him on his mule, and proceeded to the street of the jews, where\r","he quitted his servant, directing him to remain there until a certain hour; when,\r","if he did not return, he might repair to the palace the duke then seated the\r","person in the mask behind him, and rode, i know not whither; but in that night\r","he was assassinated, and thrown into the river the servant, after having been\r","dismissed, was also assaulted and mortally wounded; and although he was\r","attended with great care, yet such was his situation that he could give no\r","intelligible account of what had befallen his master in the morning, the duke not\r","having returned to the palace, his servants began to be alarmed; and one of\r","them informed the pontiff of the evening excursion of his sons, and that the duke\r","had not yet made his appearance this gave the pope no small anxiety; but he\r","conjectured that the duke had been attracted by some courtesan to pass the\r","night with her, and, not choosing to quit the house in open day, waited till the\r","following evening to return home when, however, the evening arrived, and he\r","found himself disappointed in his expectations, he became deeply afflicted, and\r","began to make inquiries from different persons, whom he ordered to attend him\r","for that purpose amongst these was a man named giorgio schiavoni, who,\r","having discharged some timber from a bark in the river, had remained on board\r","the vessel to watch it; and being interrogated whether he had seen any one\r","thrown into the river on the night preceding, he replied, that he saw two men on\r","foot, who came down the street, and looked diligently about, to observe whether\r","any person was passing that seeing no one, they returned, and a short time\r","later two others came, and looked around in the same manner as the former: no\r","person still appearing, they gave a sign to their companions, when a man came,\r","mounted on a white horse, having behind him a dead body, the head and arms\r","of which hung on one side, and the feet on the other side of the horse; the two\r","persons on foot supporting the body to prevent its falling they thus proceeded\r","towards that part where the filth of the city is usually discharged into the river,\r","and turning the horse, with his tail towards the water, the two persons took the\r","dead body by the arms and feet, and with all their strength flung it into the river\r","the person on horseback then asked if they had thrown it in; to which they\r","replied, 'signor, si' yes, sir he then looked towards the river, and seeing a\r","mantle floating in the stream, he inquired what it was that appeared black, to\r","which they answered, it was a mantle; and one of them throw stones upon it, in\r","consequence of which it sunk the attendants of the pontiff then inquired from\r","giorgio why he had not revealed this to the governor of the city; to which he\r","replied, that he had seen in his time a hundred dead bodies thrown into the river\r","at the same place, without any inquiry being made respecting them; and that he\r","had not, therefore, considered it as a matter of any importance the fishermen\r","and seamen were then collected and ordered to search the river, where on the\r","following evening, they found the body of the duke, with his habit entire, and\r","thirty ducats in his purse he was pierced with nine wounds, one of which was in\r","his throat, the others in his hand, body, and limbs no sooner was the pontiff\r","informed of the death of his son, and that he had been thrown, like filth, into the\r","river, than, giving way to his grief, he shut himself up in a chamber, and wept\r","bitterly the cardinal of segovia, and other attendants on the pope, went to the\r","door, and after many hours spent in persuasions and exhortations, prevailed\r","upon him to admit them from the evening of wednesday till the following\r","saturday the pope took no food; nor did he sleep from thursday morning till the\r","same hour on the ensuing day at length, however, giving way to the entreaties\r","of his attendants, he began to restrain his sorrow, and to consider the injury\r","which his own health might sustain by the further indulgence of his grief\" —\r","roscoe's leo the tenth, vol i p \r"," \r","lara a tale\r","the serfs are glad through lara's wide domain,\r","and slavery half

in silence to his castle-gate;\r","such scene his soul no more could contemplate\r","such scene reminded him of other days,\r","of skies more cloudless, moons of purer blaze,\r","of nights more soft and frequent, hearts that now--\r","no — no — the storm may beat upon his brow,\r","unfelt — unsparing — but a night like this,\r","a night of beauty mock'd such breast as his\r","he turn'd within his solitary hall,\r","and his high shadow shot along the wall;\r","there were the painted forms of other times,\r","'twas all they left of virtues or of crimes,\r","save vague tradition; and the gloomy vaults\r","that hid their dust, their foibles, and their faults;\r"," \r","and half a column of the pompous page,\r","that speeds the specious tale from age to age:\r","when history's pen its praise

roof, and saints, that there\r","o'er gothic windows knelt in pictured prayer,\r","reflected in fantastic figures grew,\r","like life, but not like mortal life, to view;\r","his bristling locks of sable, brow of gloom,\r","and the wide waving of his shaken plume,\r","glanced like a spectre's attributes, and gave\r","his aspect all that terror gives the grave\r","'twas midnight — all was slumber; the lone light\r","dimm'd in the lamp, as loth to break the night\r","hark! there be murmurs heard in lara's hall--\r","a sound--voice--a shriek--a fearful call!\r","a long, loud shriek--and silence--did they hear\r","that frantic echo burst the sleeping ear?\r","they heard and rose, and tremulously brave\r","rush where the sound invoked their aid to save;\r","they come with half-lit tapers in their hands,\r","and snatch'd in startled haste unbelted brands\r","cold as the marble where his length was laid,\r","pale as the beam that o'er his features play'd,\r","was lara stretch'd; his half-drawn sabre near,\r","dropp'd it should seem in more than nature's fear;\r","yet he was firm, or had been firm till now,\r","and still defiance knit his gather'd brow;\r","though mix'd with terror, senseless as he lay,\r","there lived upon his lip the wish to slay;\r","some half-form'd threat in utterance there had died,\r","some imprecation of despairing pride;\r","his eye was almost seal'd, but not forsook\r","even in its trance the gladiator's look,\r","that oft awake his aspect could disclose,\r","and now was fix'd in horrible repose\r","they raise him — bear him: hush! he breathes, he speaks!\r","the swarthy blush recolours in his cheeks,\r","his lip resumes its red, his eye, though dim,\r","rolls wide and wild, each slowly quivering limb\r","recalls its function, but his words are strung\r","in terms that seem not of his native tongue;\r","distinct but strange, enough they understand\r","to deem them accents of another land,\r","and such they were, and meant to meet an ear\r","that hears him not — alas! that cannot hear!\r","his page approach'd, and he alone appear'd\r","to know the import of the words they heard;\r","and by the changes of his cheek and brow\r","they were not such as lara should avow,\r","nor he interpret, yet with less surprise\r","than those around their chieftain's state he eyes,\r","but lara's prostrate form he bent beside,\r","and in that tongue which seem'd his own replied,\r","and lara heeds those tones that gently seem\r","to soothe away the horrors of his dream;\r","if dream it were, that thus could overthrow\r","a breast that needed not ideal woe\r","whate'er his frenzy dream'd or eye beheld,\r","if yet remember'd ne'er to be reveal'd,\r","rests at his heart: the custom'd morning came,\r","and breathed new vigour in his shaking frame;\r","and solace sought he none from priest nor leech,\r","and soon the same in movement and in speech\r","as heretofore he fill'd the passing hours,\r","nor less he smiles, nor more his forehead lours\r","than these were wont; and if the coming night\r","appear'd less welcome now to lara's sight,\r","he to his marvelling vassals shew'd it not,\r","whose shuddering proved their fear was less forgot\r","in trembling pairs alone they dared not crawl\r","the astonish'd slaves, and shun the fated hall;\r","the waving banner, and the clapping door;\r","the rustling tapestry, and the echoing floor;\r","    \r","the long dim shadows of surrounding trees,\r","the flapping bat, the night song of the breeze;\r","aught they behold or hear their thought appals\r","as evening saddens o'er the dark gray walls\r","vain thought! that hour of ne'er unravell'd gloom\r","came not again, or lara could assume\r","a seeming of forgetfulness that made\r","his vassals more amazed nor less afraid--\r","had memory vanish'd then with sense restored?\r","since word, nor look, nor gesture of their lord\r","betray'd a feeling that recall'd to these\r","that fever'd moment of his mind's disease\r","was it a dream? was his the voice that spoke\r","those strange wild accents; his the cry that broke\r","their slumber? his the oppress'd o'er-labour'd heart\r","that ceased to beat, the look that made them start?\r","could he who thus had suffer'd, so forget\r","when such as saw that suffering shudder yet?\r","or did that silence prove his memory fix'd\r","too deep for words, indelible, unmix'd\r","in that corroding secresy which gnaws\r","the heart to shew the effect, but not the cause?\r","not so in him; his breast had buried both,\r","nor common gazers could discern the growth\r","of thoughts that mortal lips must leave half told;\r","they choke the feeble words that would unfold\r","in him inexplicably mix'd appear'd\r","much to be loved and hated, sought and fear'd;\r","opinion varying o'er his hidden lot,\r","in praise or railing ne'er his name forgot;\r","his silence form'd a theme for others' prate--\r","they guess'd--they gazed--they fain would know his fate\r","what had he been? what was he, thus unknown,\r","who walk'd their world, his lineage only known?\r","a hater of his kind? yet some would say,\r","with them he could seem gay amidst the gay;\r","but own'd that smile, if oft observed and near,\r","waned in its mirth and wither'd to a sneer;\r","    \r","that smile might reach his lip, but pass'd not by,\r","none e'er could trace its laughter to his eye:\r","yet there was softness too in his regard,\r","at times, a heart as not by nature hard,\r","but once perceived, his spirit seem'd to chide\r","such weakness, as unworthy of its pride,\r","and steel'd itself, as scorning to redeem\r","one doubt from others' half withheld esteem;\r","in self-inflicted penance of a breast\r","which tenderness might once have wrung from rest;\r","in vigilance of grief that would compel\r","the soul to hate for having loved too well\r","there was in him a vital scorn of all:\r","as if the worst had fall'n which could befall,\r","he stood a stranger in this breathing world,\r","an erring spirit from another hurled;\r","a thing of dark imaginings, that shaped\r","by choice the perils he by chance escaped;\r","but 'scaped in vain, for in their memory yet\r","his mind would half exult and half regret:\r","with more capacity for love than earth\r","bestows on most of mortal mould and birth,\r","his early dreams of good outstripp'd the truth,\r","and troubled manhood follow'd baffled youth;\r","with thought of years in phantom chase misspent,\r","and wasted powers for better purpose lent;\r","and fiery passions that had pour'd their wrath\r","in hurried desolation o'er his path,\r","and left the better feelings all at strife\r","in wild reflection o'er his stormy life;\r","but haughty still, and loth himself to blame,\r","he call'd on nature's self to share the shame,\r","and charged all faults upon the fleshly form\r","she gave to clog the soul, and feast the worm;\r","'till he at last confounded good and ill,\r","and half mistook for fate the acts of will:\r","too high for common selfishness, he could\r","at times resign his own for others' good,\r","but not in pity, not because he ought,\r","but in some strange perversity of thought,\r","     \r","that sway'd him onward with a secret pride\r","to do what few or none would do beside;\r","and this same impulse would, in tempting time,\r","mislead his spirit equally to crime;\r","so much he soar'd beyond, or sunk beneath\r","the men with whom he felt condemn'd to breathe,\r","and long'd by good or ill to separate\r","himself from all who shared his mortal state;\r","his mind abhorring this had fix'd her throne\r","far from the world, in regions of her own;\r","thus coldly passing all that pass'd below,\r","his blood in temperate seeming now would flow:\r","ah! happier if it ne'er with guilt had glow'd,\r","but ever in that icy smoothness flow'd:\r","'tis true, with other men their path he walk'd,\r","and like the rest in seeming did and talk'd,\r","nor outraged reason's rules by flaw nor start,\r","his madness was not of the head, but heart;\r","and rarely wander'd in his speech, or drew\r","his thoughts so forth as to offend the view\r","with all that chilling mystery of mien,\r","and seeming gladness to remain unseen,\r","he had if 'twere not nature's boon an art\r","of fixing memory on another's heart:\r","it was not love, perchance — nor hate — nor aught\r","that words can image to express the thought;\r","but they who saw him did not see in vain,\r","and once beheld, would ask of him again:\r","and those to whom he spake remember'd well,\r","and on the words, however light, would dwell\r","none knew nor how, nor why, but he entwined\r","himself perforce around the hearer's mind;\r","there he was stamp'd, in liking, or in hate,\r","if greeted once; however brief the date\r","that friendship, pity, or aversion knew,\r","still there within the inmost thought he grew\r","you could not penetrate his soul, but found\r","despite your wonder, to your own he wound\r","his presence haunted still; and from the breast\r","he forced an all-unwilling interest;\r","    \r","vain was the struggle in that mental net,\r","his spirit seem'd to dare you to forget!\r","there is a festival, where knights and dames,\r","and aught that wealth or lofty lineage claims,\r","appear — a high-born and a welcomed guest\r","to otho's hall came lara with the rest\r","the long carousal shakes the illumined hall,\r","well speeds alike the banquet and the ball;\r","and the gay dance of bounding beauty's train\r","links grace and harmony in happiest chain:\r","blest are the early hearts and gentle hands\r","that mingle there in well according bands;\r","it is a sight the careful brow might smooth,\r","and make age smile, and dream itself to youth,\r","and youth forget such hour was pass'd on earth,\r","so springs the exulting bosom to that mirth!\r","and lara gazed on these sedately glad,\r","his brow belied him if his soul was sad,\r","and his glance follow'd fast each fluttering fair,\r","whose steps of lightness woke no echo there:\r","he lean'd against the lofty pillar nigh\r","with folded arms and long attentive eye,\r","nor mark'd a glance so sternly fix'd on his,\r","ill brook'd high lara scrutiny like this:\r","at length he caught it, 'tis a face unknown,\r","but seems as searching his, and his alone;\r","prying and dark, a stranger's by his mien,\r","who still till now had gazed on him unseen;\r","at length encountering meets the mutual gaze\r","of keen inquiry, and of mute amaze;\r","on lara's glance emotion gathering grew,\r","as if distrusting that the stranger threw;\r","along the stranger's aspect fix'd and stern\r","flash'd more than thence the vulgar eye could learn\r","''tis he!' the stranger cried, and those that heard\r","re-echo'd fast and far the whisper'd word\r","''tis he!'--''tis who?' they question far and near,\r","till louder accents rang on lara's ear;\r","so widely spread, few bosoms well could brook\r","the general marvel, or that single look;\r","but lara stirr'd not, changed not, the surprise\r","that sprung at first to his arrested eyes\r","seem'd now subsided, neither sunk nor raised\r","glanced his eye round, though still the stranger gazed;\r","and drawing nigh, exclaim'd, with haughty sneer,\r","''tis he!--how came he thence?--what doth he here?'\r","it were too much for lara to pass by\r","such question, so repeated fierce and high;\r","with look collected, but with accent cold,\r","more mildly firm than petulantly bold,\r","he turn'd, and met the inquisitorial tone--\r","'my name is lara!--when thine own is known,\r","doubt not my fitting answer to requite\r","the unlook'd for courtesy of such a knight\r","'tis lara!--further wouldst thou mark or ask?\r","i shun no question, and i wear no mask'\r","'thou shunn'st no question! ponder — is there none\r","thy heart must answer, though thine ear would shun?\r","and deem'st thou me unknown too? gaze again!\r","at least thy memory was not given in vain\r","oh! never canst thou cancel half her debt,\r","eternity forbids thee to forget'\r","with slow and searching glance upon his face\r","grew lara's eyes, but nothing there could trace\r","they knew, or chose to know--with dubious look\r","he deign'd no answer, but his head he shook,\r","and half contemptuous turn'd to pass away;\r","but the stern stranger motion'd him to stay\r","'a word!--i charge thee stay, and answer here\r","to one, who, wert thou noble, were thy peer,\r","but as thou wast and art--nay, frown not, lord,\r","if false, 'tis easy to disprove the word--\r","but as thou wast and art, on thee looks down,\r","distrusts thy smiles, but shakes not at thy frown\r","art thou not he? whose deeds--'\r","   \r","'whate'er i be,\r","words wild as these, accusers like to thee,\r","i list no further; those with whom they weigh\r","may hear the rest, nor venture to gainsay\r","the wondrous tale no doubt thy tongue can tell,\r","which thus begins courteously and well\r","let otho cherish here his polish'd guest,\r","to him my thanks and thoughts shall be express'd'\r","and here their wondering host hath interposed--\r","'whate'er there be between you undisclosed,\r","this is no time nor fitting place to mar\r","the mirthful meeting with a wordy war\r","if thou, sir ezzelin, hast ought to show\r","which it befits count lara's ear to know,\r","to-morrow, here, or elsewhere, as may best\r","beseem your mutual judgment, speak the rest;\r","i pledge myself for thee, as not unknown,\r","though, like count lara, now return'd alone\r","from other lands, almost a stranger grown;\r","and if from lara's blood and gentle birth\r","i augur right of courage and of worth,\r","he will not that untainted line belie,\r","nor aught that knighthood may accord deny'\r","'to-morrow be it,' ezzelin replied,\r","'and here our several worth and truth be tried:\r","i gage my life, my falchion to attest\r","my words, so may i mingle with the blest!'\r","what answers lara? to its centre shrunk\r","his soul, in deep abstraction sudden sunk;\r","the words of many, and the eyes of all\r","that there were gather'd, seem'd on him to fall;\r","but his were silent, his appear'd to stray\r","in far forgetfulness away--away--\r","alas! that heedlessness of all around\r","bespoke remembrance only too profound\r","'to-morrow!--ay, to-morrow!'--further word\r","than those repeated none from lara heard;\r","upon his brow no outward passion spoke,\r","from his large eye no flashing anger broke;\r","     \r","yet there was something fix'd in that low tone\r","which shew'd resoe, determined, though unknown\r","he seized his cloak--his head he slightly bow'd,\r","and passing ezzelin he left the crowd;\r","and as he pass'd him, smiling met the frown\r","with which that chieftain's brow would bear him down:\r","it was nor smile of mirth, nor struggling pride\r","that curbs to scorn the wrath it cannot hide;\r","but that of one in his own heart secure\r","of all that he would do, or could endure\r","could this mean peace? the calmness of the good?\r","or guilt grown old in desperate hardihood?\r","alas! too like in confidence are each\r","for man to trust to mortal look or speech;\r","from deeds, and deeds alone, may he discern\r","truths which it wrings the unpractised heart to learn\r","and lara call'd his page, and went his way--\r","well could that stripling word or sign obey:\r","his only follower from those climes afar\r","where the soul glows beneath a brighter star;\r","for lara left the shore from whence he sprung,\r","in duty patient, and sedate though young;\r","silent as him he served, his fate appears\r","above his station, and beyond his years\r","though not unknown the tongue of lara's land,\r","in such from him he rarely heard command;\r","but fleet his step, and clear his tones would come,\r","when lara's lip breathed forth the words of home:\r","those accents, as his native mountains dear,\r","awake their absent echoes in his ear,\r","friends', kindreds', parents', wonted voice recall,\r","now lost, abjured, for one--his friend, his all:\r","for him earth now disclosed no other guide;\r","what marvel then he rarely left his side?\r","light was his form, and darkly delicate\r","that brow whereon his native sun had sate,\r","but had not marr'd, though in his beams he grew,\r","the cheek where oft the unbidden blush shone through;\r","  \r","yet not such blush as mounts when health would show\r","all the heart's hue in that delighted glow;\r","but 'twas a hectic tint of secret care\r","that for a burning moment fever'd there;\r","and the wild sparkle of his eye seem'd caught\r","from high, and lighten'd with electric thought,\r","though its black orb those long low lashes' fringe\r","had temper'd with a melancholy tinge;\r","yet less of sorrow than of pride was there,\r","or, if 'twere grief, a grief that none should share:\r","and pleased not him the sports that please his age,\r","the tricks of youth, the frolics of the page;\r","for hours on lara he would fix his glance,\r","as all-forgotten in that watchful trance;\r","and from his chief withdrawn, he wander'd lone,\r","brief were his answers, and his questions none;\r","his walk the wood, his sport some foreign book;\r","his resting-place the bank that curbs the brook;\r","he seem'd, like him he served, to live apart\r","from all that lures the eye, and fills the heart;\r","to know no brotherhood; and take from earth\r","no gift beyond that bitter boon--our birth\r","if aught he loved, 'twas lara; but was shown\r","his faith in reverence and in deeds alone;\r","in mute attention; and his care, which guess'd\r","each wish, fulfill'd it ere the tongue express'd\r","still there was haughtiness in all he did,\r","a spirit deep that brook'd not to be chid;\r","his zeal, though more than that of servile hands,\r","in act alone obeys, his air commands;\r","as if 'twas lara's less than\r","his\r","desire\r","that thus he served, but surely not for hire\r","slight were the tasks enjoin'd him by his lord,\r","to hold the stirrup, or to bear the sword;\r","to tune his lute, or, if he will'd it more,\r","on tomes of other times and tongues to pore;\r","but ne'er to mingle with the menial train,\r","to whom he shew'd not deference nor disdain,\r","but that well-worn reserve which proved he knew\r","no sympathy with that familiar crew:\r","his soul, whate'er his station or his stem,\r","could bow to lara, not descend to them\r","of higher birth he seem'd, and better days,\r","nor mark of vulgar toil that hand betrays,\r","so femininely white it might bespeak\r","another sex, when match'd with that smooth cheek,\r","but for his garb, and something in his gaze,\r","more wild and high than woman's eye betrays;\r","a latent fierceness that far more became\r","his fiery climate than his tender frame:\r","true, in his words it broke not from his breast,\r","but from his aspect might be more than guess'd\r","kaled his name, though rumour said he bore\r","another ere he left his mountain shore;\r","for sometimes he would hear, however nigh,\r","that name repeated loud without reply,\r","as unfamiliar, or, if roused again,\r","start to the sound, as but remember'd then;\r","unless 'twas lara's wonted voice that spake,\r","for then, ear, eyes, and heart would all awake\r","he had look'd down upon the festive hall,\r","and mark'd that sudden strife so mark'd of all;\r","and when the crowd around and near him told\r","their wonder at the calmness of the bold,\r","their marvel how the high-born lara bore\r","such insult from a stranger, doubly sore,\r","the colour of young kaled went and came,\r","the lip of ashes, and the cheek of flame;\r","and o'er his brow the dampening heart-drops threw\r","the sickening iciness of that cold dew\r","that rises as the busy bosom sinks\r","with heavy thoughts from which reflection shrinks\r","yes — there be things which we must dream and dare\r","and execute ere thought be half aware:\r","whate'er might kaled's be, it was enow\r","to seal his lip, but agonise his brow\r","he gazed on ezzelin till lara cast\r","that sidelong smile upon on the knight he pass'd;\r","     \r","when kaled saw that smile his visage fell,\r","as if on something recognised right well;\r","his memory read in such a meaning more\r","than lara's aspect unto others wore\r","forward he sprung--a moment, both were gone,\r","and all within that hall seem'd left alone;\r","each had so fix'd his eye on lara's mien,\r","all had so mix'd their feelings with that scene,\r","that when his long dark shadow through the porch\r","no more relieves the glare of yon high torch,\r","each pulse beats quicker, and all bosoms seem\r","to bound as doubting from too black a dream,\r","such as we know is false, yet dread in sooth,\r","because the worst is ever nearest truth\r","and they are gone--but ezzelin is there,\r","with thoughtful visage and imperious air;\r","but long remain'd not; ere an hour expired\r","he waved his hand to otho, and retired\r","the crowd are gone, the revellers at rest;\r","the courteous host, and all-approving guest,\r","again to that accustom'd couch must creep\r","where joy subsides, and sorrow sighs to sleep,\r","and man, o'erlabour'd with his being's strife,\r","shrinks to that sweet forgetfulness of life:\r","there lie love's feverish hope and cunning's guile,\r","hate's working brain and lull'd ambition's wile;\r","o'er each vain eye oblivion's pinions wave,\r","and quench'd existence crouches in a grave\r","what better name may slumber's bed become?\r","night's sepulchre, the universal home,\r","where weakness, strength, vice, virtue, sunk supine,\r","alike in naked helplessness recline;\r","glad for awhile to heave unconscious breath,\r","yet wake to wrestle with the dread of death,\r","and shun, though day but dawn on ills increased,\r","that sleep, the loveliest, since it dreams the least\r","canto the second\r"," \r","night wanes--the vapours round the mountains curl'd,\r","melt into morn, and light awakes the world\r","man has another day to swell the past,\r","and lead him near to little, but his last;\r","but mighty nature bounds as from her birth,\r","the sun is in the heavens, and life on earth;\r","flowers in the valley, splendour in the beam,\r","health on the gale, and freshness in the stream\r","immortal man! behold her glories shine,\r","and cry, exulting inly, 'they are thine!'\r","gaze on, while yet thy gladden'd eye may see,\r","a morrow comes when they are not for thee;\r","and grieve what may above thy senseless bier,\r","nor earth nor sky will yield a single tear;\r","nor cloud shall gather more, nor leaf shall fall,\r","nor gale breathe forth one sigh for thee, for all;\r","but creeping things shall revel in their spoil,\r","and fit thy clay to fertilise the soil\r","'tis morn--'tis noon--assembled in the hall,\r","the gather'd chieftains come to otho's call:\r","'tis now the promised hour, that must proclaim\r","the life or death of lara's future fame;\r","when ezzelin his charge may here unfold,\r","and whatsoe'er the tale, it must be told\r","his faith was pledged, and lara's promise given,\r","to meet it in the eye of man and heaven\r","why comes he not? such truths to be divulged,\r","methinks the accuser's rest is long indulged\r","the hour is past, and lara too is there,\r","with self-confiding, coldly patient air;\r","why comes not ezzelin? the hour is past,\r","and murmurs rise, and otho's brow's o'ercast,\r","'i know my friend! his faith i cannot fear,\r","if yet he be on earth, expect him here;\r","the roof that held him in the valley stands\r","between my own and noble lara's lands;\r","my halls from such a guest had honour gain'd,\r","nor had sir ezzelin his host disdain'd,\r","but that some previous proof forbade his stay,\r","and urged him to prepare against to-day;\r","the word i pledge for his i pledge again,\r","or will myself redeem his knighthood's stain'\r","he ceased--and lara answer'd, 'i am here\r","to lend at thy demand a listening ear,\r","to tales of evil from a stranger's tongue,\r","whose words already might my heart have wrung,\r","but that i deem'd him scarcely less than mad,\r","or, at the worst, a foe ignobly bad\r","i know him not--but me it seems he knew\r","in lands where--but i must not trifle too:\r","produce this babbler--or redeem the pledge;\r","here in thy hold, and with thy falchion's edge'\r","proud otho on the instant, reddening, threw\r","his glove on earth, and forth his sabre flew\r","'the last alternative befits me best,\r","and thus i answer for mine absent guest'\r","with cheek unchanging from its sallow gloom,\r","however near his own or other's tomb;\r","with hand, whose almost careless coolness spoke\r","its grasp well-used to deal the sabre-stroke;\r","with eye, though calm, determined not to spare,\r","did lara too his willing weapon bare\r","in vain the circling chieftains round them closed,\r","for otho's frenzy would not be opposed;\r","and from his lip those words of insult fell--\r","his sword is good who can maintain them well\r","short was the conflict; furious, blindly rash,\r","vain otho gave his bosom to the gash:\r","he bled, and fell; but not with deadly wound,\r","stretch'd by a dextrous sleight along the ground\r","'demand thy life!' he answer'd not: and then\r","from that red floor he ne'er had risen again,\r","for lara's brow upon the moment grew\r","almost to blackness in its demon hue;\r","and fiercer shook his angry falchion now\r","     \r","than when his foe's was levell'd at his brow;\r","then all was stern collectedness and art,\r","now rose the unleaven'd hatred of his heart;\r","so little sparing to the foe he fell'd,\r","that when the approaching crowd his arm withheld\r","he almost turn'd the thirsty point on those\r","who thus for mercy dared to interpose;\r","but to a moment's thought that purpose bent;\r","yet look'd he on him still with eye intent,\r","as if he loathed the ineffectual strife\r","that left a foe, howe'er o'erthrown, with life;\r","as if to search how far the wound he gave\r","had sent its victim onward to his grave\r","they raised the bleeding otho, and the leech\r","forbade all present question, sign, and speech;\r","the others met within a neighbouring hall,\r","and he, incensed and heedless of them all,\r","the cause and conqueror in this sudden fray,\r","in haughty silence slowly strode away;\r","he back'd his steed, his homeward path he took,\r","nor cast on otho's tower a single look\r","vi\r","but where was he? that meteor of a night,\r","who menaced but to disappear with light\r","where was this ezzelin? who came and went\r","to leave no other trace of his intent\r","he left the dome of otho long ere morn,\r","in darkness, yet so well the path was worn\r","he could not miss it: near his dwelling lay;\r","but there he was not, and with coming day\r","came fast inquiry, which unfolded nought\r","except the absence of the chief it sought\r","a chamber tenantless, a steed at rest,\r","his host alarm'd, his murmuring squires distress'd:\r","their search extends along, around the path,\r","in dread to met the marks of prowlers' wrath:\r","but none are there, and not a brake hath borne\r","nor gout of blood, nor shred of mantle torn;\r","nor fall nor struggle hath defaced the grass,\r","which still retains a mark where murder was;\r","nor dabbling fingers left to tell the tale,\r","the bitter print of each convulsive nail,\r","when agonised hands that cease to guard,\r","wound in that pang the smoothness of the sward\r","some such had been, if here a life was reft,\r","but these were not; and doubting hope is left;\r","and strange suspicion, whispering lara's name,\r","now daily mutters o'er his blacken'd fame;\r","then sudden silent when his form appear'd,\r","awaits the absence of the thing it fear'd;\r","again its wonted wondering to renew,\r","and dye conjecture with a darker hue\r","days roll along, and otho's wounds are heal'd,\r","but not his pride; and hate no more conceal'd:\r","he was a man of power, and lara's foe,\r","the friend of all who sought to work him woe,\r","and from his country's justice now demands\r","account of ezzelin at lara's hands\r","who else than lara could have cause to fear\r","his presence? who had made him disappear,\r","if not the man on whom his menaced charge\r","had sate too deeply were he left at large?\r","the general rumour ignorantly loud,\r","the mystery dearest to the curious crowd;\r","the seeming friendlessness of him who strove\r","to win no confidence, and wake no love;\r","the sweeping fierceness which his soul betray'd,\r","the skill with which he wielded his keen blade;\r","where had his arm unwarlike caught that art?\r","where had that fierceness grown upon his heart?\r","for it was not the blind capricious rage\r","a word can kindle and a word assuage;\r","but the deep working of a soul unmix'd\r","with aught of pity where its wrath had fix'd;\r","such as long power and overgorged success\r","concentrates into all that's merciless:\r","these, link'd with that desire which ever sways\r","mankind, the rather to condemn than praise,\r","'gainst lara gathering raised at length a storm,\r","   \r","such as himself might fear, and foes would form,\r","and he must answer for the absent head\r","of one that haunts him still, alive or dead\r","vi\r","within that land was many a malcontent,\r","who cursed the tyranny to which he bent;\r","that soil full many a wringing despot saw,\r","who work'd his wantonness in form of law;\r","long war without and frequent broil within\r","had made a path for blood and giant sin,\r","that waited but a signal to begin\r","new havoc, such as civil discord blends,\r","which knows no neuter, owns but foes or friends;\r","fix'd in his feudal fortress each was lord,\r","in word and deed obey'd, in soul abhorr'd\r","thus lara had inherited his lands,\r","and with them pining hearts and sluggish hands;\r","but that long absence from his native clime\r","had left him stainless of oppression's crime,\r","and now, diverted by his milder sway,\r","all dread by slow degrees had worn away;\r","the menials felt their usual awe alone,\r","but more for him than them that fear was grown;\r","they deem'd him now unhappy, though at first\r","their evil judgment augur'd of the worst,\r","and each long restless night, and silent mood,\r","was traced to sickness, fed by solitude:\r","and though his lonely habits threw of late\r","gloom o'er his chamber, cheerful was his gate;\r","for thence the wretched ne'er unsoothed withdrew,\r","for them, at least, his soul compassion knew\r","cold to the great, contemptuous to the high,\r","the humble pass'd not his unheeding eye;\r","much he would speak not, but beneath his roof\r","they found asylum oft, and ne'er reproof\r","and they who watch'd might mark that, day by day,\r","some new retainers gather'd to his sway;\r","but most of late, since ezzelin was lost,\r","he play'd the courteous lord and bounteous host:\r","perchance his strife with otho made him dread\r","some snare prepared for his obnoxious head;\r","    \r","whate'er his view, his favour more obtains\r","with these, the people, than his fellow thanes\r","if this were policy, so far 'twas sound,\r","the million judged but of him as they found;\r","from him by sterner chiefs to exile driven\r","they but required a shelter, and 'twas given\r","by him no peasant mourn'd his rifled cot,\r","and scarce the serf could murmur o'er his lot;\r","with him old avarice found its hoard secure,\r","with him contempt forbore to mock the poor;\r","youth present cheer and promised recompense\r","detain'd, till all too late to part from thence:\r","to hate he offer'd, with the coming change,\r","the deep reversion of delay'd revenge;\r","to love, long baffled by the unequal match,\r","the well-won charms success was sure to snatch\r","all now was ripe, he waits but to proclaim\r","that slavery nothing which was still a name\r","the moment came, the hour when otho thought\r","secure at last the vengeance which he sought\r","his summons found the destined criminal\r","begirt by thousands in his swarming hall,\r","fresh from their feudal fetters newly riven,\r","defying earth, and confident of heaven\r","that morning he had freed the soil-bound slaves\r","who dig no land for tyrants but their graves!\r","such is their cry--some watchword for the fight\r","must vindicate the wrong, and warp the right;\r","religion--freedom--vengeance--what you will,\r","a word's enough to raise mankind to kill;\r","some factious phrase by cunning caught and spread,\r","that guilt may reign, and woes and worms be fed!\r","throughout that clime the feudal chiefs had gain'd\r","such sway, their infant monarch hardly reign'd;\r","now was the hour for faction's rebel growth,\r","the serfs contemn'd the one, and hated both:\r","they waited but a leader, and they found\r","one to their cause inseparably bound;\r","by circumstance compell'd to plunge again,\r","in self-defence, amidst the strife of men\r","     \r","cut off by some mysterious fate from those\r","whom birth and nature meant not for his foes,\r","had lara from that night, to him accurst,\r","prepared to meet, but not alone, the worst:\r","some reason urged, whate'er it was, to shun\r","inquiry into deeds at distance done;\r","by mingling with his own the cause of all,\r","e'en if he fail'd, he still delay'd his fall\r","the sullen calm that long his bosom kept,\r","the storm that once had spent itself and slept,\r","roused by events that seem'd foredoom'd to urge\r","his gloomy fortunes to their utmost verge,\r","burst forth, and made him all he once had been,\r","and is again; he only changed the scene\r","light care had he for life, and less for fame,\r","but not less fitted for the desperate game:\r","he deem'd himself mark'd out for others' hate,\r","and mock'd at ruin, so they shared his fate\r","what cared he for the freedom of the crowd?\r","he raised the humble but to bend the proud\r","he had hoped quiet in his sullen lair,\r","but man and destiny beset him there:\r","inured to hunters, he was found at bay;\r","and they must kill, they cannot snare the prey\r","stern, unambitious, silent he had been\r","henceforth a calm spectator of life's scene;\r","but dragg'd again upon the arena, stood\r","a leader not unequal to the feud;\r","in voice--mien--gesture--savage nature spoke,\r","and from his eye the gladiator broke\r","what boots the oft-repeated tale of strife,\r","the feast of vultures, and the waste of life?\r","the varying fortune of each separate field,\r","the fierce that vanquish, and the faint that yield?\r","the smoking ruin, and the crumbled wall?\r","in this the struggle was the same with all;\r","save that distemper'd passions lent their force\r","in bitterness that banish'd all remorse\r","none sued, for mercy know her cry was vain,\r","the captive died upon the battle-slain:\r","in either cause, one rage alone possess'd\r","the empire of the alternate victor's breast;\r","and they that smote for freedom or for sway,\r","deem'd few were slain, while more remain'd to slay\r","it was too late to check the wasting brand,\r","and desolation reap'd the famish'd land;\r","the torch was lighted, and the flame was spread,\r","and carnage smiled upon her daily bread\r","fresh with the nerve the new-born impulse strung,\r","the first success to lara's numbers clung:\r","but that vain victory hath ruin'd all;\r","they form no longer to their leader's call:\r","in blind confusion on the foe they press,\r","and think to snatch is to secure success\r","the lust of booty, and the thirst of hate,\r","lure on the broken brigands to their fate:\r","in vain he doth whate'er a chief may do,\r","to check the headlong fury of that crew,\r","in vain their stubborn ardour he would tame,\r","the hand that kindles cannot quench the flame\r","the wary foe alone hath turn'd their mood,\r","and shewn their rashness to that erring brood:\r","the feign'd retreat, the nightly ambuscade,\r","the daily harass, and the fight delay'd,\r","the long privation of the hoped supply,\r","the tentless rest beneath the humid sky,\r","the stubborn wall that mocks the leaguer's art,\r","and palls the patience of his baffled heart,\r","of these they had not deem'd: the battle-day\r","they could encounter as a veteran may;\r","but more preferr'd the fury of the strife,\r","and present death, to hourly suffering life:\r","and famine wrings, and fever sweeps away\r","his numbers melting fast from their array;\r","intemperate triumph fades to discontent,\r","and lara's soul alone seems still unbent:\r","but few remain to aid his voice and hand,\r","and thousands dwindled to a scanty band:\r","desperate, though few, the last and best remain'd\r","to mourn the discipline they late disdain'd\r","one hope survives, the frontier is not far,\r","and thence they may escape from native war;\r","and bear within them to the neighbouring state\r","an exile's sorrows, or an outlaw's hate:\r","hard is the task their fatherland to quit,\r","but harder still to perish or submit\r","it is resoed--they march--consenting night\r","guides with her star their dim and torchless flight;\r","already they perceive its tranquil beam\r","sleep on the surface of the barrier stream;\r","already they descry--is yon the bank?\r","away! 'tis lined with many a hostile rank\r","return or fly!--what glitters in the rear?\r","'tis otho's banner--the pursuer's spear!\r","are those the shepherds' fires upon the height?\r","alas! they blaze too widely for the flight:\r","cut off from hope, and compass'd in the toil,\r","less blood, perchance, hath bought a richer spoil!\r","a moment's pause--'tis but to breathe their band\r","or shall

the terror of his breast\r","this lara mark'd, and laid his hand on his:\r","it trembled not in such an hour as this;\r","his lip was silent, scarcely beat his heart,\r","his eye alone

to daring, and a front to foes;\r","and blood is mingled with the dashing stream,\r","which runs all redly till the morning beam\r","commanding, aiding, animating all,\r","where foe appear'd to press, or friend to fall,\r","cheers lara's voice, and waves or strikes his steel,\r","inspiring hope himself had ceased to feel\r","none fled, for well they knew that flight were vain,\r","but those that waver turn to smite again,\r","while yet they find the firmest of the foe\r","recoil before their leader's look and blow;\r","now girt with numbers, now almost alone,\r","he foils their ranks, or reunites his own;\r","himself he spared not--once they seem'd to fly--\r","now was the time, he waved his hand on high,\r","and shook--why sudden droops that plumed crest?\r","the shaft is sped--the arrow's in his breast!\r","that fatal gesture left the unguarded side,\r","and death hath stricken down yon arm of pride\r","the word of triumph fainted from his tongue;\r","that hand, so raised, how droopingly it hung!\r","but yet the sword instinctively retains,\r","though from its fellow shrink the falling reins;\r","these kaled snatches: dizzy with the blow,\r","and senseless bending o'er his saddle-bow\r","perceives not lara that his anxious page\r","beguiles his charger from the combat's rage:\r","meantime his followers charge and charge again;\r","too mix'd the slayers now to heed the slain!\r","day glimmers on the dying and the dead,\r","the cloven cuirass, and the helmless head;\r","the war-horse masterless is on the earth,\r","and that last gasp hath burst his bloody girth:\r","and near, yet quivering with what life remain'd,\r","the heel that urged him, and the hand that rein'd:\r","and some too near that rolling torrent lie,\r","whose waters mock the lip of those that die;\r","that panting thirst which scorches in the breath\r","of those that die the soldier's fiery death,\r","in vain impels the burning mouth to crave\r","one drop--the last--to cool it for the grave;\r","with feeble and convulsive effort swept\r","their limbs along the crimson'd turf have crept:\r","the faint remains of life such struggles waste,\r","but yet they reach the stream, and bend to taste:\r","they feel its freshness, and almost partake--\r","why pause?--no further thirst have they to slake--\r","it is unquench'd, and yet they feel it not--\r","it was an agony--but now forgot!\r","beneath a lime, remoter from the scene,\r","where but for him that strife had never been,\r","a breathing but devoted warrior lay:\r","'twas lara bleeding fast from life away\r","his follower once, and now his only guide,\r","kneels kaled watchful o'er his welling side,\r","and with his scarf would stanch the tides that rush\r","with each convulsion in a blacker gush;\r","and then, as his faint breathing waxes low,\r","in feebler, not less fatal tricklings flow:\r","he scarce can speak, but motions him 'tis vain,\r","and merely adds another throb to pain\r","he clasps the hand that pang which would assuage,\r","and sadly smiles his thanks to that dark page,\r","who nothing fears, nor feels, nor heeds, nor sees,\r","save that damp brow which rests upon his knees;\r","save that pale aspect, where the eye, though dim,\r","held all the light that shone on earth for him\r","the foe arrives, who long had search'd the field,\r","their triumph nought till lara too should yield;\r","they would remove him, but they see 'twere vain,\r","and he regards them with a calm disdain,\r","that rose to reconcile him with his fate,\r","and that escape to death from living hate:\r","and otho comes, and leaping from his steed,\r","looks on the bleeding foe that made him bleed,\r","and questions of his state; he answers not,\r","scarce glances on him as on one forgot,\r","and turns to kaled:--each remaining word,\r","they understood not, if distinctly heard;\r","his dying tones are in that other tongue,\r","to which some strange remembrance wildly clung\r","they spake of other scenes, but what--is known\r","to kaled, whom their meaning reach'd alone;\r","and he replied, though faintly, to their sound,\r","while gazed the rest in dumb amazement round:\r","they seem'd even then--that twain--unto the last\r","to half forget the present in the past;\r","to share between themsees some separate fate,\r","whose darkness none beside should penetrate\r","their words though faint were many — from the tone\r","their import those who heard could judge alone;\r","from this, you might have deem'd young kaled's death\r","more near than lara's by his voice and breath,\r","so sad, so deep, and hesitating broke\r","the accents his scarce-moving pale lips spoke;\r","but lara's voice, though low, at first was clear\r","and calm, till murmuring death gasp'd hoarsely near:\r","but from his visage little could we guess,\r","so unrepentant, dark, and passionless,\r","save that when struggling nearer to his last,\r","upon that page his eye was kindly cast;\r","and once, as kaled's answering accents ceased,\r","rose lara's hand, and pointed to the east:\r","whether as then the breaking sun from high\r","roll'd back the clouds the morrow caught his eye,\r","or that 'twas chance, or some remember'd scene\r","that raised his arm to point where such had been,\r","scarce kaled seem'd to know, but turn'd away,\r","as if his heart abhorr'd that coming day,\r","and shrunk his glance before that morning light\r","to look on lara's brow — where all grew night\r","yet sense seem'd left, though better were its loss;\r","for when one near display'd the absoing cross,\r","and proffer'd to his touch the holy bead,\r","of which his parting soul might own the need,\r","he look'd upon it with an eye profane,\r","and smiled — heaven pardon! if 'twere with disdain;\r","and kaled, though he spoke not, nor withdrew\r","from lara's face his fix'd despairing view,\r","with brow repulsive, and with gesture swift,\r","flung back the hand which held the sacred gift,\r","as if such but disturb'd the expiring man,\r","nor seem'd to know his life but then began,\r","the life immortal infinite, secure,\r","to all for whom that cross hath made it sure!\r","but gasping heaved the breath that lara drew,\r","and dull the film along his dim eye grew;\r","his limbs stretch'd fluttering, and his head droop'd o'er\r","the weak yet still untiring knee that bore:\r","he press'd the hand he held upon his heart--\r","it beats no more, but kaled will not part\r","with the cold grasp, but feels, and feels in vain,\r","for that faint throb which answers not again\r","'it beats!' --away, thou dreamer! he is gone--\r","it once was lara which thou look'st upon\r","he gazed, as if not yet had pass'd away\r","the haughty spirit of that humble clay;\r","     \r","and those around have roused him from his trance,\r","but cannot tear from thence his fixed glance;\r","and when in raising him from where he bore\r","within his arms the form that felt no more,\r","he saw the head his breast would still sustain,\r","roll down like earth to earth upon the plain;\r","he did not dash himself thereby, nor tear\r","the glossy tendrils of his raven hair,\r","but strove to stand and gaze, but reel'd and fell,\r","scarce breathing more than that he loved so well\r","than that he lov'd! oh! never yet beneath\r","the breast of man such trusty love may breathe!\r","that trying moment hath at once reveal'd\r","the secret long and yet but half conceal'd;\r","in baring to revive that lifeless breast,\r","its grief seem'd ended, but the sex confess'd;\r","and life return'd, and kaled felt no shame--\r","what now to her was womanhood or fame?\r","and lara sleeps not where his fathers sleep,\r","but where he died his grave was dug as deep;\r","nor is his mortal slumber less profound,\r","though priest nor bless'd, nor marble deck'd the mound;\r","and he was mourn'd by one whose quiet grief,\r","less loud, outlasts a people's for their chief\r","vain was all question ask'd her of the past,\r","and vain e'en menace — silent to the last;\r","she told nor whence nor why she left behind\r","her all for one who seem'd but little kind\r","why did she love him? curious fool!--be still--\r","is human love the growth of human will?\r","to her he might be gentleness; the stern\r","have deeper thoughts than your dull eyes discern,\r","and when they love, your smilers guess not how\r","beats the strong heart, though less the lips avow\r","they were not common links that form'd the chain\r","that bound to lara kaled's heart and brain;\r","but that wild tale she brook'd not to unfold,\r","and seal'd is now each lip that could have told\r","   \r","they laid him in the earth, and on his breast,\r","besides the wound that sent his soul to rest,\r","they found the scattered dints of many a scar\r","which were not planted there in recent war:\r","where'er had pass'd his summer years of life,\r","it seems they vanish'd in a land of strife;\r","but all unknown his glory or his guilt,\r","these only told that somewhere blood was spilt\r","and ezzelin, who might have spoke the past,\r","return'd no more--that night appear'd his last\r","upon that night a peasant's is the tale\r","a serf that cross'd the intervening vale,\r","when cynthia's light almost gave way to morn,\r","and nearly veil'd in mist her waning horn;\r","a serf, that rose betimes to thread the wood,\r","and hew the bough that bought his children's food,\r","pass'd by the river that divides the plain\r","of otho's lands and lara's broad domain:\r","he heard a tramp--a horse and horseman broke\r","from out the wood--before him was a cloak\r","wrapt round some burthen at his saddle-bow,\r","bent was his head, and hidden was his brow\r","roused by the sudden sight at such a time,\r","and some foreboding that it might be crime,\r","himself unheeded watch'd the stranger's course,\r","who reach'd the river, bounded from his horse,\r","and lifting thence the burthen which he bore,\r","heaved up the bank, and dash'd it from the shore,\r","then paused, and look'd, and turn'd, and seem'd to watch,\r","and still another hurried glance would snatch,\r","and follow with his step the stream that flow'd,\r","as if even yet too much its surface show'd:\r","at once he started, stoop'd, around him strewn\r","the winter floods had scatter'd heaps of stone;\r","of these the heaviest thence he gather'd there,\r","and slung them with a more than common care\r","meantime the serf had crept to where unseen\r","himself might safely mark what this might mean\r","he caught a glimpse, as of a floating breast,\r","and something glitter'd starlike on the vest,\r","     \r","but ere he well could mark the buoyant trunk,\r","a massy fragment smote it, and it sunk:\r","it rose again, but indistinct to view,\r","and left the waters of a purple hue,\r","then deeply disappear'd: the horseman gazed\r","till ebb'd the latest eddy it had raised;\r","then turning, vaulted on his pawing steed,\r","and instant spurr'd him into panting speed\r","his face was mask'd--the features of the dead,\r","if dead it were,

fetes--\r","all warsaw gathered round his gates\r","to gaze upon his splendid court,\r","and dames, and chiefs, of princely port\r","he was the polish solomon,\r","so sung his poets, all but one,\r","who, being unpensioned, made a satire,\r","and boasted that he could not flatteri\r","it was a court of jousts and mimes,\r","where every courtier tried at rhymes;\r","even i for once

it were a joy to die\r","a brow like a midsummer lake,\r","transparent with the sun therein,\r","when waves no murmur dare to make,\r","and heaven beholds her face within\r","a cheek and lip--but why

sturdy trees,\r","that bent not to the roughest breeze\r","which howls down from siberia's waste,\r","and strips the forest in its haste,--\r","but these were few and far between,\r","set thick with shrubs more young and green,\r","luxuriant with their annual leaves,\r","ere strown by those autumnal eves\r","that nip the forest's foliage dead,\r","discoloured with a lifeless red,\r","which stands thereon like stiffened gore\r","upon the slain when battle's o'er,\r","and some long winter's night hath shed\r","its frost o'er every tombless head,\r","  \r","so cold and stark, the raven's beak\r","may peck unpierced each frozen cheek:\r","'twas a wild waste of underwood,\r","and here and there a chestnut stood,\r","the strong oak, and the hardy pine;\r","but far apart--and well it were,\r","or else a different lot were mine--\r","the boughs gave way, and did not tear\r","my limbs; and i found strength to bear\r","my wounds, already scarred with cold--\r","my bonds forbade to loose my hold\r","we rustled through the leaves like wind,\r","left shrubs, and trees, and woes behind;\r","by night i heard them on the track,\r","their troop came hard upon our back,\r","with their long gallop, which can tire\r","the hound's deep hate, and hunter's fire:\r","where'er we flew they followed on,\r","nor left us with the morning sun;\r","behind i saw them, scarce a rood,\r","at day-break winding through the wood,\r","and through the night had heard their feet\r","their stealing, rustling step repeat\r","oh! how i wished for spear or sword,\r","at least to die amidst the horde,\r","and perish--if it must be so--\r","at bay, destroying many a foe\r","when first my courser's race begun,\r","i wished the goal already won;\r","but now i doubted strength and speed:\r","vain doubt! his swift and savage breed\r","had nerved him like the mountain-roe--\r","nor faster falls the blinding snow\r","which whelms the peasant near the door\r","whose threshold he shall cross no more,\r","bewildered with the dazzling blast,\r","than through the forest-paths--he passed--\r","untired, untamed, and worse than wild;\r","all furious as a favoured child\r","balked of its wish; or fiercer still\r","a woman piqued--who has her will\r"," \r","'the wood was passed; 'twas more than noon,\r","but chill the air, although in june;\r","or it might be my veins ran cold--\r","prolonged endurance tames the bold;\r","and i was then not what i seem,\r","but headlong as a wintry stream,\r","and wore my feelings out before\r","i well could count their causes o'er:\r","and what with fury, fear, and wrath,\r","the tortures which beset my path,\r","cold, hunger, sorrow, shame, distress,\r","thus bound in nature's nakedness;\r","sprung from a race whose rising blood\r","when stirred beyond its calmer mood,\r","and trodden hard upon, is like\r","the rattle-snake's, in act to strike--\r","what marvel if this worn-out trunk\r","beneath its woes a moment sunk?\r","the earth gave way, the skies rolled round,\r","i seemed to sink upon the ground;\r","but erred, for i was fastly bound\r","my heart turned sick, my brain grew sore,\r","and throbbed awhile, then beat no more:\r","the skies spun like a mighty wheel;\r","i saw the trees like drunkards reel,\r","and a slight flash sprang o'er my eyes,\r","which saw no farther he who dies\r","can die no more than then i died;\r","o’ertortured by that ghastly ride\r","i felt the blackness come and go,\r","and strove to wake; but could not make\r","my senses climb up from below:\r","i felt as on a plank at sea,\r","when all the waves that dash o'er thee,\r","at the same time upheave and whelm,\r","and hurl thee towards a desert realm\r","my undulating life was as\r","the fancied lights that flitting pass\r","our shut eyes in deep midnight, when\r","fever begins upon the brain;\r","but soon it passed, with little pain,\r","  \r","but a confusion worse than such:\r","i own that i should deem it much,\r","dying, to feel the same again;\r","and yet i do suppose we must\r","feel far more ere we turn to dust:\r","no matter; i have bared my brow\r","full in death's face--before--and now\r","'my thoughts came back; where was i? cold,\r","and numb, and giddy: pulse by pulse\r","life reassumed its lingering hold,\r","and throb by throb--till grown a pang;\r","which for a moment would convulse,\r","my blood reflowed, though thick and chill;\r","my ear with uncouth noises rang,\r","my heart began once more to thrill;\r","my sight returned, though dim; alas!\r","and thickened, as it were, with glass\r","methought the dash of waves was nigh,\r","there was a gleam too of the sky\r","studded with stars;--it is no dream;\r","the wild horse swims the wilder stream!\r","the bright broad river's gushing tide\r","sweeps, winding onward, far and wide,\r","and we are half-way, struggling o'er\r","to yon unknown and silent shore\r","the waters broke my hollow trance,\r","and with a temporary strength\r","my stiffened limbs were rebaptized\r","my courser's broad breast proudly braves,\r","and dashes off the ascending waves,\r","and onward we advance\r","we reach the slippery shore at length,\r","a haven i but little prized,\r","for all behind was dark and drear\r","and all before was night and fear\r","how many hours of night or day\r","in those suspended pangs i lay,\r","i could not tell; i scarcely knew\r","if this were human breath i drew\r"," \r","'with glossy skin, and dripping mane,\r","and reeling limbs, and reeking flank,\r","the wild steed's sinewy nerves still strain\r","up the repelling bank\r","we gain the top a boundless plain\r","spreads through the shadow of the night,\r","and onward, onward, onward, seems,\r","like precipices in our dreams,\r","to stretch beyond the sight;\r","and here and there a speck of white,\r","or scattered spot of dusky green,\r","in masses broke into the light,\r","as rose the moon upon my right:\r","but nought distinctly seen\r","in the dim waste would indicate\r","the omen of a cottage gate;\r","no twinkling taper from afar\r","stood like a hospitable star;'\r","not even an ignis-fatuus rose\r","to make him merry with my woes:\r","that very cheat had cheered me then!\r","although detected, welcome still,\r","reminding me, through every ill,\r","of the abodes of men\r","'onward we went--but slack and slow\r","his savage force at length o'erspent,\r","the drooping courser, faint and low,\r","all feebly foaming went\r","a sickly infant had had power\r","to guide him forward in that hour!\r","but, useless all to me,\r","his new-born tameness nought availed--\r","my limbs were bound; my force had failed,\r","perchance, had they been free\r","with feeble effort still i tried\r","to rend the bonds so starkly tied,\r","but still it was in vain;\r","my limbs were only wrung the more,\r","and soon the idle strife gave o'er,\r","  \r","which but prolonged their pain:\r","the dizzy race seemed almost done,\r","although no goal was nearly won\r","some streaks announced the coming sun--\r","how slow, alas! he came!\r","methought that mist of dawning grey\r","would never dapple into day;\r","how heavily it rolled away--\r","before the eastern flame\r","rose crimson, and deposed the stars,\r","and called the radiance from their cars,\r","and filled the earth, from his deep throne,\r","with lonely lustre, all his own\r","'up rose the sun; the mists were curled\r","back from the solitary world\r","which lay around--behind--before;\r","what booted it to traverse o'er\r","plain, forest, river? man nor brute,\r","nor dint of hoof, nor print of foot,\r","lay in the wild luxuriant soil;\r","no sign of travel--none of toll;\r","the very air was mute:\r","and not an insect's shrill small horn,\r","nor matin bird's new voice was borne\r","from herb nor thicket many a werst,\r","panting as if his heart would burst,\r","the weary brute still staggered on;\r","and still we were--or seemed--alone:\r","at length, while reeling on our way,\r","methought i heard a courser neigh,\r","from out yon tuft of blackening firs\r","is it the wind those branches stirs?\r","no, no! from out the forest prance\r","a trampling troop; i see them come i\r","in one vast squadron they advance!\r","i strove to cry--my lips were dumb\r","the steeds rush on in plunging pride;\r","but where are they the reins to guide?\r","a thousand horse--and none to ride!\r","with flowing tail, and flying mane,\r","  \r","wide nostrils never stretched by pain,\r","mouths bloodless to the bit or rein,\r","and feet that iron never shod,\r","and flanks unscarred by spur or rod,\r","a thousand horse, the wild, the free,\r","like waves that follow o'er the sea,\r","came thickly thundering on,\r","as if our faint approach to meet;\r","the sight re-nerved my courser's feet,\r","a moment staggering, feebly fleet,\r","a moment, with a faint low neigh,\r","he answered, and then fell!\r","with gasps and glazing eyes he lay,\r","and reeking limbs immoveable,\r","his first and last career is done!\r","on came the troop--they saw him stoop,\r","they saw me strangely bound along\r","his back with many a bloody thong\r","they stop--they start--they snuff the air,\r","gallop a moment here and there,\r","approach, retire, wheel round and round,\r","then plunging back with sudden bound,\r","headed by one black mighty steed,\r","who seemed the patriarch of his breed,\r","without a single speck or hair\r","of white upon his shaggy hide;\r","they snort--they foam--neigh--swerve aside,\r","and backward to the forest fly,\r","by instinct, from a human eye\r","they left me there to my despair,\r","linked to the dead and stiffening wretch,\r","whose lifeless limbs beneath me stretch,\r","relieved from that unwonted weight,\r","from whence i could not extricate\r","nor him nor me--and there we lay\r","the dying on the dead!\r","i little deemed another day\r","would see my houseless, helpless head\r","and there from morn till twilight bound,\r","i felt the heavy hours toll round,\r","with just enough of life to see\r","my last of suns go down on me,\r","  \r","in hopeless certainty of mind,\r","that makes us feel at length resigned\r","to that which our foreboding years\r","presents the worst and last of fears\r","inevitable--even a boon,\r","nor more unkind for coming soon,\r","yet shunned and dreaded with such care,\r","as if it only were a snare\r","that prudence might escape:\r","at times both wished for and implored,\r","at times sought with self-pointed sword,\r","yet still a dark and hideous close\r","to even intolerable woes,\r","and welcome in no shape\r","and, strange to say, the sons of pleasure,\r","they who have revelled beyond measure\r","in beauty, wassail, wine, and treasure,\r","die calm, or calmer, oft than he\r","whose heritage was misery\r","for he who hath in turn run through\r","all that was beautiful and new,\r","hath nought to hope, and nought to leave;\r","and, save the future, which is viewed\r","not quite as men are base or good,\r","but as their nerves may be endued,\r","with nought perhaps to grieve:\r","the wretch still hopes his woes must end,\r","and death, whom he should deem his friend,\r","appears, to his distempered eyes,\r","arrived to rob him of his prize,\r","the tree of his new paradise\r","tomorrow would have given him all,\r","repaid his pangs, repaired his fall;\r","tomorrow would have been the first\r","of days no more deplored or curst,\r","but bright, and long, and beckoning years,\r","seen dazzling through the mist of tears,\r","guerdon of many a painful hour;\r","tomorrow would have given him power\r","to rule, to shine, to smite, to save--\r","and must it dawn upon his grave?\r"," \r","'the sun was sinking--still i lay\r","chained to the chill and stiffening steed,\r","i thought to mingle there our clay;\r","and my dim eyes of death had need,\r","no hope arose of being freed\r","i cast my last looks up the sky,\r","and there between me and the sun\r","i saw the expecting raven fly,\r","who scarce would wait till both should die,\r","ere his repast begun;\r","he flew, and perched, then flew once more,\r","and each time nearer than before;\r","i saw his wing through twilight flit,\r","and once so near me he alit\r","i could have smote, but lacked the strength;\r","but the slight motion of my hand,\r","and feeble scratching of the sand,\r","the exerted throat's faint struggling noise,\r","which scarcely could be called a voice,\r","together scared him off at length\r","i know no more--my latest dream\r","is something of a lovely star\r","which fixed my dull eyes from afar,\r","and went and came with wandering beam,\r","and of the cold, dull, swimming, dense,\r","sensation of recurring sense,\r","and then subsiding back to death,\r","and then again a little breath,\r","a little thrill, a short suspense,\r","an icy sickness curdling o'er\r","my heart, and sparks that crossed my brain\r","a gasp, a throb, a start of pain,\r","a sigh, and nothing more\r","'i woke--where was i?--do i see\r","a human face look down on me?\r","and doth a roof above me close?\r","do these limbs on a couch repose?\r","is this a chamber where i lie\r","and is it mortal yon bright eye,\r","that watches me with gentle glance?\r","i closed my own again once more,\r","as doubtful that the former trance\r","could not as yet be o'er\r","a slender girl, long-haired, and tall,\r","sate watching by the cottage wall\r","the sparkle of her eye i caught\r","even with my first return of thought;\r","for ever and anon she threw\r","a prying, pitying glance on me\r","with her black eyes so wild and free:\r","i gazed, and gazed, until i knew\r","no vision it could be,--\r","but that i lived, and was released\r","from adding to the vulture's feast:\r","and when the cossack maid beheld\r","my heavy eyes at length unsealed,\r","she smiled--and i essayed to speak,\r","but failed--and she approached, and made\r","with lip and finger signs that said,\r","i must not strive as yet to break\r","the silence, till my strength should be\r","enough to leave my accents free;\r","and then her hand on mine she laid,\r","and smoothed the pillow for my head,\r","and stole along on tiptoe tread,\r","and gently oped the door, and spake\r","in whispers--ne'er was voice so sweet!\r","even music followed her light feet\r","but those she called were not awake,\r","and she went forth; but, ere she passed,\r","another look on me she cast,\r","another sign she made, to say,\r","that i had nought to fear, that all\r","were near, at my command or call,\r","and she would not delay\r","her due return:--while she was gone,\r","methought i felt too much alone\r","'she came with mother and with sire--\r","what need of more?--i will not tire\r","with long recital of the rest,\r","since i became the cossack's guest\r","they found me senseless on the plain\r","they bore me to the nearest hut,\r","they brought me into life again\r","me--one day o'er their realm to reign!\r","thus the vain fool who strove to glut\r","his rage, refining on my pain,\r","sent me forth to the wilderness,\r","bound, naked, bleeding, and alone,\r","to pass the desert to a throne,--\r","what mortal his own doom may guess?\r","let none despond, let none despair!\r","tomorrow the borysthenes\r","may see our coursers graze at ease\r","upon his turkish bank,--and never\r","had i such welcome for a river\r","as i shall yield when safely there\r","comrades good night!'--the hetman threw\r","his length beneath the oak-tree shade,\r","with leafy couch already made,\r","a bed nor comfortless nor new\r","to him, who took his rest whene'er\r","the hour arrived, no matter where:\r","his eyes the hastening slumbers steep\r","and if ye marvel charles forgot\r","to thank his tale, he wondered not,--\r","the king had been an hour asleep\r","  \r","monody on the death of the right hon r b\r","sheridan\r","when the last sunshine of expiring day\r","in summer's twilight weeps itself away,\r","who hath not felt the softness of the hour\r","sink on the heart, as dew along the flower?\r","with a pure feeling which absorbs and awes\r","while nature makes that melancholy pause,\r","her breathing moment on the bridge where time\r","of light and darkness forms an arch sublime,\r","who hath not shared that calm, so still and deep,\r","the voiceless thought which would not speak but weep,\r","a holy concord, and a bright regret,\r","a glorious sympathy with suns that set?\r","'tis not harsh sorrow, but a tenderer woe,\r","nameless, but dear to gentle hearts below,\r","felt without bitterness, but full and

with glassy gaze she stood\r","as ice were in her curdled blood;\r","but every now and then a tear\r","so large and slowly gather'd slid\r","from the long dark fringe of that fair lid\r","it was a thing to see, not hear!\r","and those who saw, it did surprise,\r","such drops could fall from human eyes\r","to speak she thought--the imperfect note\r","was choked within her swelling

fell like stone\r","  \r","or statue from its base o'erthrown,\r","more like a thing that ne'er had life--\r","a monument of azo's wife--\r","than her, that living guilty thing,\r","whose every passion was a sting,\r","which urged to guilt, but could not bear\r","that guilt's detection and despair\r","but yet she lived--and all too soon\r","recover'd from that death-like swoon--\r","but scarce to reason--every sense\r","had been o'erstrung by pangs intense;\r","and each frail fibre of her brain\r","as bowstrings, when relax'd by rain,\r","the erring arrow launch aside\r","sent forth her thoughts all wild and wide--\r","the past a blank, the future black,\r","with glimpses of a dreary track,\r","like lightning on the desert path,\r","when midnight storms are mustering wrath\r","she fear'd--she felt that something ill\r","lay on her soul, so deep and chill--\r","that there was sin and shame she knew;\r","that some one was to die--but who?\r","she had forgotten:--did she breathe?\r","could this be still the earth beneath\r","the sky above, and men around;\r","or were they fiends who now so frown'd\r","on one, before whose eyes each eye\r","till then had smiled in sympathy?\r","all was confused and undefined\r","to her all-jarr'd and wandering mind;\r","a chaos of wild hopes and fears:\r","and now in laughter, now in tears,\r","but madly still in each extreme,\r","she strove with that convulsive dream;\r","for so it seem'd on her to break:\r","oh! vainly must she strive to wake!\r","the convent bells are ringing,\r","but mournfully and slow:\r","in the grey square turret swinging,\r","  \r","with a deep sound, to and fro\r","heavily to the heart they go!\r","hark! the hymn is singing--\r","the song for the dead below,\r","or the living who shortly shall be so!\r","for a departing being's soul\r","the death-hymn peals and the hollow bells knoll:\r","he is near his mortal goal;\r","kneeling at the friar's knee;\r","sad to hear--and piteous to see--\r","kneeling on the bare cold ground,\r","with the block before and the guards around--\r","and the headsman with his bare arm ready,\r","that the blow may be both swift and steady,\r","feels if the axe be sharp and true--\r","since he set its edge anew:\r","while the crowd in a speechless circle gather\r","to see the son fall by the doom of the father\r","it is a lovely hour as yet\r","before the summer sun shall set,\r","which rose upon that heavy day,\r","and mock'd it with his steadiest ray;\r","and his evening beams are shed\r","full on hugo's fated head,\r","as his last confession pouring\r","to the monk, his doom deploring\r","in penitential holiness,\r","he bends to hear his accents bless\r","with absolution such as may\r","wipe our mortal stains away\r","that high sun on his head did glisten\r","as he there did bow and listen--\r","and the rings of chestnut hair\r","curl'd half down his neck so bare;\r","but brighter still the beam was thrown\r","upon the axe which near him shone\r","with a clear and ghastly glitter--\r","oh! that parting hour was bitter!\r","even the stern stood chill'd with awe:\r","dark the crime, and just the law--\r","   \r","yet they shudder'd as they saw\r","the parting prayers are said and over\r","of that false son--and daring lover!\r","his beads and sins are all recounted,\r","his hours to their last minute mounted--\r","his mantling cloak before was stripp'd,\r","his bright brown locks must now be clipp'd\r","'tis done--all closely are they shorn--\r","the vest which till this moment worn--\r","the scarf which parisina gave--\r","must not adorn him to the grave\r","even that must now be thrown aside,\r","and o'er his eyes the kerchief tied;\r","but no--that last indignity\r","shall ne'er approach his haughty eye\r","all feelings seemingly subdued,\r","in deep disdain were half renew'd,\r","when headsman's hands prepared to bind\r","those eyes which would not brook such blind\r","as if they dared not look on death\r","'no--yours my forfeit blood and breath--\r","these hands are chain'd--but let me die\r","at least with an unshackled eye--\r","strike:'--and as the word he said,\r","upon the block he bow'd his head;\r","these the last accents hugo spoke:\r","'strike:'--and flashing fell the stroke--\r","roll'd the head--and, gushing, sunk\r","back the stain'd and heaving trunk,\r","in the dust, which each deep vein\r","slaked with its ensanguined rain;\r","his eyes and lips a moment quiver,\r","convulsed and quick--then fix for ever\r","he died, as erring man should die,\r","without display, without parade;\r","meekly had he bow'd and pray'd,\r","as not disdaining priestly aid,\r","nor desperate of all hope on high\r","and while before the prior kneeling,\r","his heart was wean'd from earthly feeling;\r","  \r","his wrathful sire--his paramour--\r","what were they in such an hour?\r","no more reproach--no more despair;\r","no thought but heaven--no word but prayer--\r","save the few which from him broke,\r","when, bared to meet the headsman's stroke,\r","he claim'd to die with eyes unbound,\r","his sole adieu to those around\r","still as the lips that close in death,\r","each gazer's bosom held his breath:\r","but yet, afar, from man to man,\r","a cold electric shiver ran,\r","as down the deadly blow descended\r","on him whose life and love thus ended;\r","and, with a hushing sound compress'd,\r","a sigh shrunk back on every breast;\r","but no more thrilling noise rose there,\r","beyond the blow that to the block\r","pierced through with forced and sullen shock,\r","save one:--what cleaves the silent air\r","so madly shrill--so passing wild?\r","that, as a mother's o'er her child,\r","done to death by sudden blow,\r","to the sky these accents go,\r","like a soul's in endless woe\r","through azo's palace-lattice driven,\r","that horrid voice ascends to heaven,\r","and every eye is turn'd thereon;\r","but sound and sight alike are gone\r","it was a woman's shriek--and ne'er\r","in madlier accents rose despair;\r","and those who heard it, as it pass'd,\r","in mercy wish'd it were the last\r","hugo is fallen; and from that hour,\r","no more in palace, hall, or bower,\r","was parisina heard or seen:\r","her name--as if she ne'er had been--\r","was banish'd from each lip and ear,\r","like words of wantonness or fear;\r","and from prince azo's voice, by none\r","was mention heard of wife or son;\r","no tomb--no memory had they;\r","theirs was unconsecrated clay;\r","at least the knight's who died that day\r","but parisina's fate lies hid\r","like dust beneath the coffin lid:\r","whether in convent she abode,\r","and won to heaven her dreary road,\r","by blighted and remorseful years\r","of scourge, and fast, and sleepless tears;\r","or if she fell by bowl or steel,\r","for that dark love she dared to feel;\r","or if upon the moment smote,\r","she died by tortures less remote;\r","like him she saw upon the block,\r","with heart that shared the headsman's shock\r","in quicken'd brokenness that came,\r","in pity, o'er her shatter'd frame,\r","none knew--and none can ever know:\r","but whatso'er its end below,\r","her life began and closed in woe!\r","and azo found another bride,\r","and goodly sons grew by his side;\r","but none so lovely and so brave\r","as him who wither'd in the grave;\r","or if they were--on his cold eye\r","their growth but glanced unheeded by,\r","or noticed with a smother'd sigh\r","but never tear his cheek descended,\r","and never smile his brow unbended;\r","and o'er that fair broad brow were wrought\r","the intersected lines of thought;\r","those furrows which the burning share\r","of sorrow ploughs untimely there;\r","scars of the lacerating mind\r","which the soul's war doth leave behind\r","he was past all mirth or woe:\r","nothing more remain'd below\r","  \r","but sleepless nights and heavy days,\r","a mind all dead to

ice which ever froze\r","can only o'er the surface close--\r","the living stream lies quick below,\r","and flows--and cannot cease to flow\r","still was his seal'd-up bosom haunted\r","by thoughts which nature had implanted;\r","too deeply rooted thence to vanish,\r","howe'er our stifled fears we banish;\r","when, struggling as they rise to start,\r","we check those waters of the heart,\r","they are not dried--those tears unshed,\r","but flow back to the fountain head,\r","and resting in their spring more pure,\r","forever in its depth endure,\r","unseen, unwept, but uncongeal'd,\r","and cherish'd most where least reveal'd\r","with inward starts of feeling left,\r","to throb o'er those of life bereft;\r","without the power to fill again\r","the desert gap which made his pain;\r","without the hope to meet them where\r","united souls shall gladness share,\r","with all the consciousness that he\r","had only pass'd a just decree;\r","that they had wrought their doom of ill;\r","yet azo's age was wretched still\r","the tainted branches of the tree,\r","if lopp'd with care, a strength may give,\r","by which the rest shall bloom and live\r","all greenly fresh

youth\r","standing upon a hill, a gentle hill,\r","green and of mild declivity, the last\r","as 'twere the cape of a long ridge of such,\r","save that there was no sea to lave its base,\r","but a most living landscape, and the wave\r","of woods and corn-fields, and the abodes of men\r","scattered at intervals, and wreathing smoke\r","  \r","arising from such rustic roofs: the hill\r","was crowned with a peculiar diadem\r","of trees, in circular array, so fixed,\r","not by the sport of nature, but of man:\r","these two, a maiden and a youth, were there\r","gazing -the one on all that was beneath\r","fair as herself -but the boy gazed on her;\r","and both were young, and one was beautiful:\r","and both were young -yet not alike in youth\r","as the sweet moon on the horizon's verge,\r","the maid was on the eve of womanhood;\r","the boy had fewer summers, but his heart\r","had far outgrown his years, and to his eye\r","there was but one beloved face on earth,\r","and that was shining on him; he had looked\r","upon it till it could not pass away;\r","he had no breath, no being, but in hers:\r","she was his voice; he did not speak to her,\r","but trembled on her words; she was his sight,\r","for his eye followed hers, and saw with hers,\r","which coloured all his objects; -he had ceased\r","to live within himself: she was his life,\r","the ocean to the river of his thoughts,\r","which terminated all; upon a tone,\r","a touch of hers, his blood would ebb and flow,\r","and his cheek change tempestuously -his heart\r","unknowing of its cause of agony\r","but she in these fond feelings had no share:\r","her sighs were not for him; to her he was\r","even as a brother -but no more; 'twas much,\r","for brotherless she was, save in the name\r","her infant friendship had bestowed on him;\r","herself the solitary scion left\r","of a time-honoured race -it was a name\r","which pleased him, and yet pleased him not -and why?\r","time taught him a deep answer -when she loved\r","another; even now she loved another,\r","and on the summit of that hill she stood\r","looking afar if yet her lover's steed\r","kept pace with her expectancy, and flew\r","a change came o'er the spirit of my dream\r","there was an ancient mansion, and before\r","its walls there was a steed caparisoned:\r","within an antique oratory stood\r","the boy of whom i spake; -he was alone,\r","and pale, and pacing to and fro: anon\r","he sate him down, and seized a pen, and traced\r","words which i could not guess of; then he leaned\r","his bowed head on his hands and shook, as 'twere\r","with a convulsion -then rose again,\r","and with his teeth and quivering hands did tear\r","what he had written, but he shed no tears\r","and he did calm himself, and fix his brow\r","into a kind of quiet: as he paused,\r","the lady of his love re-entered there;\r","she was serene and smiling then, and yet\r","she knew she was by him beloved; she knew -\r","for quickly comes such knowledge -that his heart\r","was darkened with her shadow, and she saw\r","that he was wretched, but she saw not all\r","he rose, and with a cold and gentle grasp\r","he took her hand; a moment o'er his face\r","a tablet of unutterable thoughts\r","was traced, and then it faded, as it came;\r","he dropped the hand he held, and with slow steps\r","retired, but not as bidding her adieu,\r","for they did part with mutual smiles; he passed\r","from out the massy gate of that old hall,\r","and mounting on his steed he went his way;\r","and ne'er repassed that hoary threshold more\r","a change came o'er the spirit of my dream\r","the boy was sprung to manhood: in the wilds\r","of fiery climes he made himself a home,\r","and his soul drank their sunbeams; he was girt\r","with strange and dusky aspects; he was not\r","himself like what he had been; on the sea\r","and on the shore he was a wanderer;\r","there was a mass of many images\r","   \r","crowded like waves upon me, but he was\r","a part of all; and in the last he lay\r","reposing from the noontide sultriness,\r","couched among fallen columns, in the shade\r","of ruined walls that had survived the names\r","of those who reared them; by his sleeping side\r","stood camels grazing, and some goodly steeds\r","were fastened near a fountain; and a man,\r","glad in a flowing garb, did watch the while,\r","while many of his tribe slumbered around:\r","and they were canopied by the blue sky,\r","so cloudless, clear, and purely beautiful,\r","that god alone was to be seen in heaven\r","a change came o'er the spirit of my dream\r","the lady of his love was wed with one\r","who did not love her better: in her home,\r","a thousand leagues from his, -her native home,\r","she dwelt, begirt with growing infancy,\r","daughters and sons of beauty, -but behold!\r","upon her face there was a tint of grief,\r","the settled shadow of an inward strife,\r","and an unquiet drooping of the eye,\r","as if its lid were charged with unshed tears\r","what could her grief be? -she had all she loved,\r","and he who had so loved her was not there\r","to trouble with bad hopes, or evil wish,\r","or ill-repressed affliction, her pure thoughts\r","what could her grief be? -she had loved him not,\r","nor given him cause to deem himself beloved,\r","nor could he be a part of that which preyed\r","upon her mind -a spectre of the past\r","vi\r","a change came o'er the spirit of my dream\r","the wanderer was returned -i saw him stand\r","before an altar -with a gentle bride;\r","her face was fair, but was not that which made\r","the starlight of his boyhood; -as he stood\r","   \r","even at the altar, o'er his brow there came\r","the selfsame aspect and the quivering shock\r","that in the antique oratory shook\r","his bosom in its solitude; and then -\r","as in that hour -a moment o'er his face\r","the tablet of unutterable thoughts\r","was traced -and then it faded as it came,\r","and he stood calm and quiet, and he spoke\r","the fitting vows, but heard not his own words,\r","and all things reeled around him; he could see\r","not that which was, nor that which should have been -\r","but the old mansion, and the accustomed hall,\r","and the remembered chambers, and the place,\r","the day, the hour, the sunshine, and the shade,\r","all things pertaining to that place and hour,\r","and her who was his destiny, came back\r","and thrust themsees between him and the light;\r","what business had they there at such a time?\r","a change came o'er the spirit of my dream\r","the lady of his love; -oh! she was changed,\r","as by the sickness of the soul; her mind\r","had wandered from its dwelling, and her eyes,\r","they had not their own lustre, but the look\r","which is not of the earth; she was become\r","the queen of a fantastic realm; her thoughts\r","were combinations of disjointed things;\r","and forms impalpable and unperceived\r","of others' sight familiar were to hers\r","and this the world calls frenzy; but the wise\r","have a far deeper madness, and the glance\r","of melancholy is a fearful gift;\r","what is it but the telescope of truth?\r","which strips the distance of its fantasies,\r","and brings life near in utter nakedness,\r","making the cold reality too real!\r","vi\r","a change came o'er the spirit of my dream\r"," \r","the wanderer was alone as heretofore,\r","the beings which surrounded him were gone,\r","or were at war with him; he was a mark\r","for blight and desolation, compassed round\r","with hatred and contention; pain was mixed\r","in all which was served up to him, until,\r","like to the pontic monarch of old days,\r","he fed on poisons, and they had no power,\r","but were a kind of nutriment; he lived\r","through that which had been death to many men,\r","and made him friends of mountains; with the stars\r","and the quick spirit of the universe\r","he held his dialogues: and they did teach\r","to him the magic of their mysteries;\r","to him the book of night was opened wide,\r","and voices from the deep abyss revealed\r","a marvel and a secret -be it so\r","my dream is past; it had no further change\r","it

time\r","a life of pain, an age of crime\r","o'er him who loves, or hates, or fears,\r","such moment pours the grief of years:\r","what felt he then, at once opprest\r","by all that most distracts the breast?\r","that pause, which pondered o'er his fate,\r","oh, who its dreary length shall date!\r","though in time's record nearly nought,\r","it was eternity to thought!\r","for infinite as boundless space\r","the thought that conscience must embrace,\r","which in itself can comprehend\r","woe without name, or hope, or end\r","the hour is past, the giaour is gone;\r","and did he fly or fall

vanished from the stall;\r","no serf is seen in hassan’s hall;\r","the lonely spider’s thin grey pall\r","waves slowly widening o’er the wall;\r","the bat builds in his harem bower,\r","and in the fortress of his power\r","the owl usurps the beacon-tower;\r","the wild-dog howls o’er the fountain’s brim,\r","with baffled thirst and famine, grim;\r","for the stream has shrunk from its marble bed,\r","where the weeds and the desolate dust are spread\r","‘twas sweet of yore to see it play\r","and chase the sultriness of day,\r","as springing high the sier dew\r","in whirls fantastically flew,\r","and flung luxurious coolness round\r","the air, and verdure o’er the ground\r","‘twas sweet, when cloudless stars were bright,\r","to view the wave of watery light,\r","and hear its melody by night\r","and oft had hassan’s childhood played\r","around the verge of that cascade;\r","and oft upon his mother’s breast\r","that sound had harmonized his rest;\r","and oft had hassan’s youth along\r","its bank been soothed by beauty’s song;\r","and softer seem’d each melting tone\r","of music mingled with its own\r","but ne’er shall hassan’s age repose\r","along the brink at twilight’s close:\r","the stream that filled that font is fled -\r","the blood that warmed his heart is shed!\r","and here no more shall human voice\r","be heard to rage, regret, rejoice\r","the last sad note that swelled the gale\r","    \r","was woman’s wildest funeral wall:\r","that quenched in silence all is still,\r","but the lattice that flaps when the wind is shrill:\r","though raves the gust, and floods the rain,\r","no hand shall clasp its clasp again\r","on desert sands ‘twere joy to scan\r","the rudest steps of fellow man,\r","so here the very voice of grief\r","might wake an echo like relief -\r","at least ‘twould say, ‘all are not gone;\r","there lingers life, though but in one’ -\r","for many a gilded chamber’s there,\r","which solitude might well forbear;\r","within that dome as yet decay\r","hath slowly worked her cankering way -\r","but gloom is gathered o’er the gate,\r","nor there the fakir’s self will wait;\r","nor there will wandering dervise stay,\r","for bounty cheers not his delay;\r","nor there will weary stranger halt\r","to bless the sacred ‘bread and salt’\r","alike must wealth and poverty\r","pass heedless and unheeded by,\r","for courtesy and pity

it withdrew;\r","still less and less, a speck of white\r","that gemmed the tide, then mocked the sight;\r","and all its hidden secrets sleep,\r","known but to genii of the deep,\r","which, trembling in their coral caves,\r","they dare not whisper to the waves\r","as rising on its purple wing\r","the insect-queen of eastern spring,\r","o’er emerald meadows of kashmeer\r","invites the young pursuer

enough that all within that cave\r","was love, though buried strong as in the grave,\r","where abelard, through twenty years of death,\r","when eloisa's form was lowered beneath\r","their nuptial vault, his arms outstretched, and pressed\r","the kindling ashes to his kindled breast\r","the waves without sang round their couch, their roar\r","as much unheeded as if life were o'er;\r","within, their hearts made all their harmony,\r","love's broken murmur and more broken sigh\r","   \r","and they, the cause and sharers of the shock\r","which left them exiles of the hollow rock,\r","where were they? o'er the sea for life they plied,\r","to seek from heaven the shelter men denied\r","another course had been their choice-but where?\r","the wave which bore them still their foes would bear,\r","who, disappointed of their former chase,\r","in search of christian now renewed their race\r","eager with anger, their strong arms made way,\r","like vultures baffled of thir previous prey\r","they gained upon them, all whose safety lay\r","in some bleak crag or deeply-hidden bay:\r","no further chance or choice remained; and right\r","for the first further rock which met their sight\r","they steered, to take their latest view of land,\r","and yield as victims, or die sword in hand;\r","dismissed the natives and their shallop, who\r","would still have battled for that scanty crew;\r","but christian bade them seek their shore again,\r","nor add a sacrifice which were in vain;\r","for what were simple bow and savage spear\r","against the arms which must be wielded here?\r","they landed on a wild but narrow scene,\r","where few but nature's footsteps yet had been;\r","prepared their arms, and with that gloomy eye,\r","stern and sustained, of man's extremity,\r","when hope is gone, nor glory's self remains\r","to cheer resistance against death or chains,-\r","they stood, the three, as the three hundred stood\r","who dyed thermopylae with holy blood\r","but, ah! how different!

spilt,\r","their life was shame, their epitaph was guilt\r","  \r","and this they knew and felt, at least the one,\r","the leader of the band he had undone;\r","who, born perchance for better things, had set\r","his life upon a cast which lingered yet:\r","but now the die was to be thrown, and all\r","the chances were in favour of his fall:\r","and such a fall! but still he faced the shock,\r","obdurate as a portion of the rock\r","whereon he stood, and fixed his levelled gun,\r","dark as a sullen cloud before the sun\r","the boat drew nigh, well armed, and firm the crew\r","to act whatever duty bade them do\r","careless of danger, as the onward wind\r","is of the leaves it strews, nor looks behind\r","and, yet, perhaps, they rather wished to go\r","against a nation's than a native foe,\r","and felt that this poor victim of self-will,\r","briton no more, had once been britain's still\r","they hailed him to surrender-no reply;\r","their arms were poised, and glittered in the sky\r","they hailed again-no answer; yet once more\r","they offered quarter louder than before\r","the echoes only, from the rock's rebound,\r","took their last farewell of the dying sound\r","then flashed the flint, and blazed the volleying flame,\r","and the smoke rose between them and their aim,\r","while the rock rattled with the bullets' knell,\r","which pealed in vain, and flattened as they fell;\r","then flew the only answer to be given\r","by those who had lost all hope in earth or heaven\r","after the first fierce peal as they pulled nigher,\r","they heard the voice of christian shout, 'now, fire!'\r","and ere the word upon the echo died,\r","two fell; the rest assailed the rock's rough side,\r","and, furious at the madness of their foes,\r","disdained all further efforts, save to close\r","but steep the crag, and all without a path,\r","each step opposed a bastion to their wrath,\r","while, placed 'midst clefts the least accessible,\r","which christian's eye was trained to mark full well,\r","   \r","the three maintained a strife which must not yield,\r","in spots where eagles might have chosen to build\r","their every shot told; while the assailant fell,\r","dashed on the shingles like the limpet shell;\r","but still enough survived, and mounted still,\r","scattering their numbers here and there, until\r","surrounded and commanded, though not nigh\r","enough for seizure, near enough to die,\r","the desperate trio held aloof their fate\r","but by a thread, like sharks who have gorged the bait;\r","yet to the very last they battled well,\r","and not a groan informed their foes who fell\r","christian died last-twice wounded; and once more\r","mercy was offered when they saw his gore;\r","too late for life, but not too late to die,\r","with, though a hostile band, to close his eye\r","a limb was broken, and he drooped along\r","the crag, as doth a falcon reft of young\r","the sound revived him, or appeared to wake\r","some passion which a weakly gesture spake:\r","he beckoned to the foremost, who drew nigh,\r","but, as they neared, he reared his weapon high-\r","his last ball had been aimed, but from his breast\r","he tore the topmost button from his vest,\r","down the tube dashed it-levelled-fired, and smiled\r","as his foe fell; then, like a serpent, coiled\r","his wounded, weary form, to where the steep\r","looked desperate as himself along the deep;\r","cast one glance back, and clenched his hand, and shook\r","his last rage 'gainst the earth which he forsook;\r","then plunged: the rock below received like glass\r","his body crushed into one gory mass,\r","with scarce a shred to tell of human form,\r","or fragment for the sea-bird or the worm;\r","a fair-haired scalp, besmeared with blood and weeds,\r","yet reeked, the remnant of himself and deeds;\r","some splinters of his weapons to the last,\r","as long as hand could hold, he held them fast\r","yet glittered, but at distance-hurled away\r","to rust beneath the dew and dashing spray\r","the rest was nothing-save a life mis-spent,\r","and soul-but who shall answer where it went?\r","  \r","'tis ours to bear, not judge the dead; and they\r","who doom to hell, themsees are on the way,\r","unless these bullies of eternal pains\r","are pardoned their bad hearts for their worse brains\r","the deed was over! all were gone or ta'en,\r","the fugitive, the captive, or the slain\r","chained on the deck, where once, a gallant crew,\r","they stood with honour, were the wretched few\r","survivors of the skirmish on the isle;\r","but the last rock left no surviving spoil\r","cold lay they where they fell, and weltering,\r","while o'er them flapped the sea-birds' dewy wing,\r","now wheeling nearer from the neighbouring surge,\r","and screaming high their harsh and hungry dirge:\r","but calm and careless heaved the wave below,\r","eternal with unsympathetic flow;\r","far o'er its face the dolphins sported on,\r","and sprung the flying fish against the sun,\r","till its dried wing relapsed from its brief height,\r","to gather moisture for another flight\r","'twas morn; and neuha, who by dawn of day\r","swam smoothly forth to catch the rising ray,\r","and watch if aught approached the amphibious lair\r","where lay her lover, saw a sail in air:\r","it flapped, it filled, and to the growing gale\r","bent its broad arch: her breath began to fail\r","with fluttering fear, her heart beat thick and high,\r","while yet a doubt sprung where its course might lie\r","but no! it came not; fast and far away\r","the shadow lessened as it cleared the bay\r","she gazed, and flung the sea-foam from her eyes,\r","to watch as for a rainbow in the skies\r","on the horizon verged the distant deck,\r","diminished, dwindled to a very speck-\r","then vanished all was ocean, all was joy!\r","down plunged she through the cave to rouse her boy;\r","told all she had seen, and all she hoped, and all\r","that happy love could augur or recall;\r"," \r","sprung forth again, with torquil following free\r","his bounding nereid over the broad sea;\r","swam round the rock, to where a shallow cleft\r","hid the canoe that neuha there had left\r","drifting along the tide, without an oar,\r","that eve the strangers chased them from the shore;\r","but when these vanished, she pursued her prow,\r","regained, and urged to where they found it now:\r","nor ever did more love and joy embark,\r","than now were wafted in that slender ark\r","again their own shore rises on the view,\r","no more polluted with a hostile hue;\r","no sullen ship lay bristling o'er the foam,\r","a floating dungeon:-all was hope and home!\r","a thousand proas darted o'er the bay,\r","with sounding shells, and heralded their way;\r","the chiefs came down, around the people poured,\r","and welcomed torquil as a son restored;\r","the women thronged, embracing and embraced\r","by neuha, asking where they had been chased,\r","and how escaped? the tale was told; and then\r","one acclamation rent the sky again;\r","and from that hour a new tradition gave\r","their sanctuary the name of 'neuha's cave'\r","a hundred fires, far flickering from the height,\r","blazed o'er the general revel of the night,\r","the feast in honour of the guest, returned\r","to peace and pleasure, perilously earned;\r","a night succeeded by such happy days\r","as only the yet infant world displays\r","     \r","the isles of greece\r","the isles of greece, the isles of greece!\r","   where burning sappho loved and sung,\r","   where grew the arts of war and peace,\r","   where delos rose, and phoebus\r","   sprung!\r","   eternal summer gilds them yet,\r","   but all, except their sun, is set\r","    the mountains look on marathon--\r","    and marathon looks on the sea;\r","    and musing there an hour alone,\r","    i dreamed that greece might still be free;\r","    for standing on the persians' grave,\r","    i could not deem myself a slave\r","    a king sat on the rocky brow\r","    which looks o'er sea-born salamis;\r","    and ships, by thousands, lay below,\r","    and men in nations--all were his!\r","    he counted them at break of day--\r","    and when the sun set, where were they?\r","    and where are they? and where art thou?\r","    my country? on thy voiceless shore\r","    the heroic lay is tuneless now--\r","    the heroic bosom beats no more!\r","    and must thy lyre, so long divine,\r","    degenerate into hands like mine?\r","    'tis something, in the dearth of fame,\r","    though linked among a fettered race,\r","    to feel at least a patriot's shame,\r","    even as i sing, suffuse my face;\r","    for what is left the poet here?\r","    for greeks a blush--for greece a tear\r","    fill high the bowl with samian wine!\r","    our virgins dance beneath the shade--\r","    i see their glorious black eyes shine;\r","  \r","     but gazing on each glowing maid,\r","    my own the burning teardrop laves,\r","    to think such breasts must suckle slaves\r","    place me on sunium's marbled steep,\r","    where nothing, save the waves and i,\r","    may hear our mutual murmurs sweep;\r","    there, swanlike, let me sing and die:\r","    a land of slaves shall ne'er be mine--\r","    dash down yon cup of samian wine!\r"," \r","the lament of tasso\r","long years!--it tries the thrilling frame to bear\r","and eagle-spirit of a child of song--\r","long years of outrage, calumny, and wrong;\r","imputed madness, prison'd solitude,\r","and the mind's canker in its savage mood,\r","when the impatient thirst of light and air\r","parches the heart; and the abhorred grate,\r","marring the sunbeams with its hideous shade,\r","works through the throbbing eyeball to the brain,\r","with a hot sense of heaviness and pain;\r","and bare, at once, captivity display'd\r","stands scoffing through the never-open'd gate,\r","which nothing through its bars admits, save day,\r","and tasteless food, which i have eat alone\r","till its unsocial bitterness is gone;\r","and i can banquet like a beast of prey,\r","sullen and lonely, crouching in the cave\r","which is my lair, and--it may be--my grave\r","all this hath somewhat worn me, and may wear,\r","but must be borne i stoop not to despair;\r","for i have battled with mine agony,\r","and made me wings wherewith to overfly\r","the narrow circus of my dungeon wall,\r","and freed the holy sepulchre from thrall,\r","and revell'd among men and things divine,\r","and pour'd my spirit over palestine,\r","in honour of the sacred war for him,\r","the god who was on earth and is in heaven,\r","for he has strengthen'd me in heart and limb\r","that through this sufferance i might be forgiven,\r","i have employ'd my penance to record\r","how salem's shrine was won and how adored\r","but this is o'er--my pleasant task is done:--\r","my long-sustaining friend of many years!\r","if i do blot thy final page with tears,\r","know, that my sorrows have wrung from me none\r","    \r","but thou, my young creation! my soul's child!\r","which ever playing round me came and smiled,\r","and woo'd me from myself with thy sweet sight,\r","thou too art gone--and so is my delight:\r","and therefore do i weep and inly bleed\r","with this last bruise upon a broken reed\r","thou too art ended--what is left me now?\r","for i have anguish yet to bear--and how?\r","i know not that--but in the innate force\r","of my own spirit shall be found resource\r","i have not sunk, for i had no remorse,\r","nor cause for such: they call'd me mad — and why?\r","o leonora! wilt not thou reply?\r","i was indeed delirious in my heart\r","to lift my love so loft as thou art;\r","but still my frenzy was not of the mind;\r","i knew my fault, and feel my punishment\r","not less because i suffer it unbent\r","that thou wert beautiful, and i not blind,\r","hath been the sin which shuts me from mankind;\r","but let them go, or torture as they will,\r","my heart can multiply thine image still;\r","successful love may sate itself away,\r","the wretched are the faithful; 'tis their fate\r","to have all feeling save the one decay,\r","and every passion into one dilate,\r","as rapid rivers into ocean pour;\r","but ours is fathomless, and hath no shore\r","above me, hark! the long and maniac cry\r","of minds and bodies in captivity,\r","and hark! the lash and the increasing howl,\r","and the half-inarticulate blasphemy!\r","there be some here with worse than frenzy foul,\r","some who do still goad on the o'erlabour'd mind,\r","and dim the little light that's left behind\r","with needless torture, as their tyrant will\r","is wound up to the lust of doing ill:\r","with these and with their victims am i class'd,\r","'mid sounds and sights like these long years have passed;\r","'mid sounds and sights like these my life may close:\r","     \r","so let it be--for then i shall repose\r","i have been patient, let me be so yet;\r","i had forgotten half i would forget,\r","but it revives--oh! i would it were my lot\r","to be forgetful as i am forgot!--\r","feel i not wroth with those who bade me dwell\r","in this vast lazar-house of many woes?\r","where laughter is not mirth, nor thought the mind,\r","nor words a language, nor even men mankind;\r","where cries reply to curses, shrieks to blows,\r","and each is tortured in his separate hell--\r","for we are crowded in our solitudes--\r","many, but each divided by the wall,\r","which echoes madness in her babbling moods;--\r","while all can hear, none heed his neighbour's call--\r","none! save that one, the veriest wretch of all,\r","who was not made to be the mate of these,\r","nor bound between distraction and disease\r","feel i not wroth with those who placed me here?\r","who have debased me in the minds of men,\r","debarring me the usage of my own,\r","blighting my life in best of its career,\r","branding my thoughts as things to shun and fear?\r","would i not pay them back these pangs again,\r","and teach them inward sorrow's stifled groan?\r","the struggle to be calm, and cold distress,\r","which undermines our stoical success?\r","no!--still too proud to be vindictive--i\r","have pardon'd princes' insults, and would die\r","yes, sister of my sovereign! for thy sake\r","i week all bitterness from out my breast,\r","it hath no business where thou art a guest;\r","thy brother hates--but i can not detest;\r","though pitiest not--but i can not forsake\r","look on a love which knows not to despair,\r","but all unquench'd is still my better part,\r","dwelling deep in my shut and silent heart,\r","as dwells the gather'd lightning in its cloud,\r","encompass'd with its dark and rolling shroud,\r","till struck--forth flies the all-ethereal dart!\r","and thus at the collision of thy name\r","the vivid thought still flashes through my frame,\r","and for a moment all things as they were\r","flit by me;--they are gone--i am the same\r","and yet my love without ambition grew;\r","i knew thy state, my station, and i knew\r","a princess was no love-mate for a bard;\r","i told it not, i breathed it not, it was\r","sufficient to itself, its own reward;\r","and if my eyes reveal'd it, they, alas!\r","were punish'd by the silentness of thine,\r","and yet i did not venture to repine\r","thou wert to me a crystal-girded shrine\r","worshipp'd at holy distance, and around\r","hallow'd and meekly kiss'd the saintly ground;\r","nor for thou wert a princess, but that love\r","had robed thee with a glory, and array'd\r","thy lineaments in a beauty that dismay'd--\r","oh! not dismay'd--but awed, like one above!\r","and in that sweet severity there was\r","a something which all softness did surpass--\r","i know not how--thy genius master'd mine--\r","my star stood still before thee:--if it were\r","presumptuous thus to love without design,\r","that sad fatality hath cost me dear;\r","but thou art dearest still, and i should be\r","fit for this cell, which wrongs me--but for thee\r","the very love which lock'd me to my chain\r","hath lighten'd half its weight; and for the rest,\r","though heavy, lent me vigour to sustain,\r","and look to thee with undivided breast,\r","and foil the ingenuity of pain\r","vi\r","it is no marvel--from my very birth\r","my soul was drunk with love--which did pervade\r","and mingle with whate'er i saw on earth;\r","of objects all inanimate i made\r","idols, and out of wild and lonely flowers,\r","and rocks, whereby they grew, a paradise,\r","    \r","where i did lay me down within the shade\r","of waving trees, and dream'd uncounted hours,\r","though i was chid for wandering; and the wise\r","shook their white aged heads o'er me, and said\r","of such materials wretched men were made,\r","and such a truant boy would end in woe\r","and that the only lesson was a blow;\r","and then they smote me, and i did not weep,\r","but cursed them in my heart, and to my haunt\r","return'd and wept alone, and dream'd again\r","the visions which arise without a sleep\r","and with my years my soul began to pant\r","with feelings of strange tumult and soft pain;\r","and the whole heart exhaled into one want,\r","but undefined and wandering, till the day\r","i found the thing i sought--and that was thee;\r","and then i lost my being all to be\r","absorb'd in thine--the world was pass'd away--\r","thou didst annihilate the earth to me!\r","i loved all solitude--but little thought\r","to spend i know not what of life, remote\r","from all communion with existence, save\r","the maniac and his tyrant;--had i been\r","their fellow, many years ere this had seen\r","my mind like theirs corrupted to its grave,\r","but who hath seen me writhe, or heard me rave?\r","perchance in such a cell we suffer more\r","than the wreck'd sailor on his desert shore:\r","the world is all before him--mine is here,\r","scarce twice the space they must accord my bier\r","what though he perish, he may lift his eye\r","and with a dying glance upbraid the sky--\r","i will not raise my own in such

with their clank,\r"," i saw it silently decline--\r"," and so perchance in sooth did mine:\r","but yet i forced it on to cheer\r","those relics of a home so dear\r","he was a hunter of the

natural or inspired--\r","he, too, was struck, and day by day\r","was wither'd on the stalk away\r","oh, god! it is a fearful thing\r","to see the human soul take wing\r","in any shape, in any mood:\r","i've seen it rushing forth in blood,\r","i've seen it on the breaking ocean\r","strive with a swoln convulsive motion,\r","i've seen the sick and ghastly bed\r","of sin delirious with its dread:\r","but these were horrors--this was woe\r","unmix'd with such--but sure and slow:\r","he faded, and so calm and meek,\r","so softly worn, so sweetly weak,\r","so tearless, yet so tender--kind,\r","and grieved for those he left behind;\r","with all the while a cheek whose bloom\r","was as a mockery of the tomb\r","whose tints as gently sunk away\r","as a departing rainbow's ray;\r","an eye of most transparent light,\r","that almost made the dungeon bright;\r","and not a word of murmur--not\r","a groan o'er his untimely lot,--\r","a little talk of better days,\r","a little hope my own to raise,\r","for i was sunk in silence--lost\r","  \r","in this last loss, of all the most;\r","and then the sighs he would suppress\r","of fainting nature's feebleness,\r","more slowly drawn, grew less and less:\r","i listen'd, but i could not hear;\r","i call'd, for i was wild with fear;\r","i knew 'twas hopeless, but my dread\r","would not be thus admonished;\r","i call'd, and thought i heard a sound--\r","i burst my chain with one strong bound,\r","and rushed to him:--i found him not,\r","i only stirred in this black spot,\r","i only lived, i only drew\r","the accursed breath of dungeon-dew;\r","the last, the sole, the dearest link\r","between me and the eternal brink,\r","which bound me to my failing race\r","was broken in this fatal place\r","one on the earth, and one beneath--\r","my brothers--both had ceased to breathe:\r","i took that hand which lay so still,\r","alas! my own was full as chill;\r","i had not strength to stir, or strive,\r","but felt that i was still alive--\r","a frantic feeling, when we know\r","that what we love shall ne'er be so\r","    i know not why\r","    i could not die,\r","i had no earthly hope--but faith,\r","and that forbade a selfish death\r","what next befell me then and there\r","  i know not well--i never knew--\r","first came the loss of light, and air,\r","  and then of darkness too:\r","i had no thought, no feeling--none--\r","among the stones i stood a stone,\r","and was, scarce conscious what i wist,\r","as shrubless crags within the mist;\r","for all was blank, and bleak, and grey;\r","it was not night--it was not day;\r","it was not even the dungeon-light,\r","so hateful to my heavy sight,\r","but vacancy absorbing space,\r","and fixedness--without a place;\r","there were no stars, no earth, no time,\r","no check, no change, no good, no crime\r","but silence, and a stirless breath\r","which neither was of life nor death;\r","a sea of stagnant idleness,\r","blind, boundless, mute, and motionless!\r","a light broke in upon my brain,--\r","  it was the carol of a bird;\r","it ceased, and then it came again,\r","  the sweetest song ear ever heard,\r","and mine was thankful till my eyes\r","ran over with the glad surprise,\r","and they that moment could not see\r","i was the mate of misery;\r","but then by dull degrees came back\r","my senses to their wonted track;\r","i saw the dungeon walls and floor\r","close slowly round me as before,\r","i saw the glimmer of the sun\r","creeping as it before had done,\r","but through the crevice where it came\r","that bird was perch'd, as fond and tame,\r","  and tamer than upon the tree;\r","a lovely bird, with azure wings,\r","and song that said a thousand things,\r","  and seemed to say them all for me!\r","i never saw its like before,\r","i ne'er shall see its likeness more:\r","it seem'd like me to want a mate,\r","but was not half so desolate,\r","and it was come to love me when\r","none lived to love me so again,\r","and cheering from my dungeon's brink,\r","had brought me back to feel and think\r","i know not if it late were free,\r","  or broke its cage to perch on mine,\r","but knowing well captivity,\r","  sweet bird! i could not wish for thine!\r","or if it were, in winged guise,\r"," \r","a visitant from paradise;\r","for--heaven forgive that thought! the while\r","which made me both to weep and smile--\r","i sometimes deem'd that it might be\r","my brother's soul come down to me;\r","but then at last away it flew,\r","and then 'twas mortal well i knew,\r","for he would never thus have flown--\r","and left me twice so doubly lone,--\r","lone as the corse within its shroud,\r","lone as a solitary cloud,\r","  a single cloud on a sunny day,\r","while all the rest of heaven is clear,\r","a frown upon the atmosphere,\r","that hath no business to appear\r","  when skies are blue, and earth is gay\r","a kind of change came in my fate,\r","my keepers grew compassionate;\r","i know not what had made them so,\r","they were inured to sights of woe,\r","but so it was:--my broken chain\r","with links unfasten'd did remain,\r","and it was liberty to stride\r","along my cell from side to side,\r","and up and down, and then athwart,\r","and tread it over every part;\r","and round the pillars one by one,\r","returning where my walk begun,\r","avoiding only, as i trod,\r","my brothers' graves without a sod;\r","for if i thought with heedless tread\r","my step profaned their lowly bed,\r","my breath came gaspingly and thick,\r","and my crush'd heart felt blind and sick\r","i made a footing in the wall,\r"," it was not therefrom to escape,\r","for i had buried one and all,\r"," who loved me in a human shape;\r","and the whole earth would henceforth be\r","a wider prison unto me:\r","no child, no sire, no kin had i,\r","  \r","no partner in my misery;\r","i thought of this, and i was glad,\r","for thought of them had made me mad;\r","but i was curious to ascend\r","to my barr'd windows, and to bend\r","once more, upon the mountains high,\r","the quiet of a loving eye\r","i saw them--and they were the same,\r","they were not changed like me in frame;\r","i saw their thousand years of snow\r","on high--their wide long lake below,\r","and the blue rhone in fullest flow;\r","i heard the torrents leap and gush\r","o'er channell'd rock and broken bush;\r","i saw the white-wall'd distant town,\r","and whiter sails go skimming down;\r","and then there was a little isle,\r","which in my very face did smile,\r","  the only one in view;\r","a small green isle, it seem'd no more,\r","scarce broader than my dungeon floor,\r","but in it there were three tall trees,\r","and o'er it blew the mountain breeze,\r","and by it there were waters flowing,\r","and on it there were young flowers growing,\r","  of gentle breath and hue\r","the fish swam by the castle wall,\r","and they seem'd joyous each and all;\r","the eagle rode the rising blast,\r","methought he never flew so fast\r","as then to me he seem'd to fly;\r","and then new tears came in my eye,\r","and i felt troubled--and would fain\r","i had not left my recent chain;\r","and when i did descend again,\r","the darkness of my dim abode\r","fell on me as a heavy load;\r","it was as is a new-dug grave,\r","closing o'er one we sought to save,--\r","and yet my glance, too much opprest,\r","had almost need of such a rest\r","  \r"," it might be months, or years, or days--\r","  i kept no count, i took no note--\r","i had no hope my eyes to raise,\r","  and clear them of their dreary mote;\r","at last men came to set me free;\r","  i ask'd not why, and reck'd not where;\r","it was at length the same to me,\r","fetter'd or fetterless to be,\r","  i learn'd to love despair\r","and thus when they appear'd at last,\r","and all my bonds aside were cast,\r","these heavy walls to me had grown\r","a hermitage--and all my own!\r","and half i felt as they were come\r","to tear me from a second home:\r","with spiders i had friendship made\r","and watch'd them in their sullen trade,\r","had seen the mice by moonlight play,\r","and why should i feel less than they?\r","we were all inmates of one place,\r","and i, the monarch of each race,\r","had power to kill--yet, strange to tell!\r","in quiet we had learn'd to dwell;\r","my very chains and i

bands advance\r","beneath each bearded pacha's glance;\r","and far and wide as eye can reach\r","the turban'd cohorts throng the beach;\r","and there the arab's camel kneels,\r","and there his steed the tartar wheels;\r","the turcoman hath left his herd, \r","the sabre round his loins to gird;\r","and there the volleying thunders pour,\r","till waves grow smoother to the roar\r","the trench is dug, the cannon's breath\r","wings the far hissing globe of death;\r","fast whirl the fragments from the wall,\r","which crumbles with the ponderous ball;\r","and from that wall the foe replies,\r","o'er dusty plain and smoky skies,\r","with fires that answer fast and well\r","the summons of the infidel\r","  i\r","but near and nearest to the wall\r","of those who wish and work its fall,\r","with deeper skill in war's black art\r","than othman's sons, and high of heart\r","as any chief that ever stood\r","triumphant in the fields of blood;\r","from post to post, and deed to deed,\r","fast spurring on his reeking steed,\r","where sallying ranks the trench assail,\r","and make the foremost moslem quail;\r","or where the battery, guarded well,\r","remains as yet impregnable,\r","alighting cheerly to inspire\r","the soldier slackening in his fire;\r","the first and freshest of the host\r","which stamboul's sultan there can boast\r","to guide the follower o'er the field,\r","to point the tube, the lance to wield,\r","or whirl around the bickering blade; —\r","was alp, the adrian renegade!\r","   \r","from venice — once a race of worth\r","his gentle sires — he drew his birth;\r","but late an exile from her shore,\r","against his countrymen he bore\r","the arms they taught to bear; and now\r","the turban girt his shaven brow\r","through many a change had corinth pass'd\r","with greece to venice' rule at last;\r","and here, before her walls, with those\r","to greece and venice equal foes,\r","he stood a foe, with all the zeal\r","which young and fiery converts feel,\r","within whose heated bosom throngs\r","the memory of a thousand wrongs\r","to him had venice ceased to be\r","her ancient civic boast — \"the free;\"\r","and in the palace of st mark\r","unnamed accusers in the dark\r","within the \"lion's mouth\" had placed\r","a charge against him uneffaced:\r","he fled in time, and saved his life,\r","to waste his future years in strife,\r","that taught his land how great her loss\r","in him who triumph'd o'er the cross,\r","'gainst which he rear'd the crescent high,\r","and battled to avenge or die\r","     v\r","coumourgi — he whose closing scene \r","adorn'd the triumph of eugene,\r","when on carlowitz' bloody plain,\r","the last and mightiest of the slain,\r","he sank, regretting not to die,\r","but cursed the christian's victory —\r","coumourgi — can his glory cease,\r","that latest conqueror of greece,\r","till christian hands to greece restore\r","the freedom venice gave of yore?\r","a hundred years have roll'd away\r","since he refix'd the moslem's sway,\r","and now he led the mussulman,\r","and gave the guidance of the van\r","to alp, who well repaid the trust\r","by cities levell'd with the dust;\r","and proved, by many a deed of death,\r","how firm his heart in novel faith\r","    vi\r","the walls grew weak; and fast and hot\r","against them pour'd the ceaseless shot,\r"," \r","with unabating fury sent,\r","from battery to battlement;\r","and thunder-like the pealing din\r","rose from each heated cuerin;\r","and here and there some crackling dome\r","was fired before the exploding bomb;\r","and as the fabric sank beneath\r","the shattering shell's volcanic breath,\r","in red and wreathing columns flash'd\r","the flame as loud the ruin crash'd,\r","or into countless meteors driven,\r","its earth-stars melted into heaven;\r","whose clouds that day grew doubly dun?\r","impervious to the hidden sun,\r","with volumed smoke that slowly grew\r","to one wide sky of sulphurous hue\r","   v\r","but not for vengeance, long delay'd,\r","alone, did alp, the renegade,\r","the moslem warriors sternly teach\r","his skill to pierce the promised breach:\r","within those walls a maid was pent\r","his hope would win, without consent\r","of that inexorable sire,\r","whose heart refused him in its ire,\r","when alp, beneath his christian name,\r","her virgin hand aspired to claim\r","in happier mood, and earlier time,\r","while unimpeach'd for traitorous crime,\r","gayest in gondola or hall,\r","he glitter'd through the carnival;\r","and tuned the softest serenade\r","that e'er on adria's waters play'd\r","at midnight to italian maid\r","   vi\r","and many deem'd her heart was won;\r","for sought by numbers, given to none,\r","had young francesca's

to gaze;\r","with humbler care her form arrays;\r","her voice less lively in the song;\r","her step, though light, less fleet among\r","the pairs, on whom the morning's glance\r","breaks, yet unsated with the dance\r","    i\r","sent by the state to guard the land,\r","which, wrested from the moslem's hand,\r","while sobieski tamed his pride\r","by buda's wall and danube's side,\r","the chiefs of

to-morrow's earliest dawn,\r","o'er the disjointed mass shall vault\r","the foremost of the fierce assault\r","the bands are rank'd; the chosen van\r","of tartar and of mussulman,\r","the full of

like an ocean hung on high,\r","bespangled with those isles of light,\r","so wildly, spiritually bright;\r","who ever gazed upon them shining,\r","and turn'd to earth without repining,\r","nor wish'd for wings to flee away,\r","and mix with their eternal ray?\r","the waves on either shore lay there,\r","calm, clear, and azure as the air;\r","and scarce their foam the pebbles shook,\r","but murmur'd meekly as the brook\r","the winds were pillow'd on the waves;\r","the banners droop'd along their staves,\r","and, as they fell around them furling,\r","above them shone the crescent curling;\r","and that deep silence was unbroke,\r","save where the watch his signal spoke,\r","save where the steed neigh'd oft and shrill,\r","and echo answer'd from the hill,\r","and the wide hum of that wild host,\r","rustled like leaves from coast to coast,\r","as rose the muezzin's voice in air\r","in midnight call to wonted prayer;\r","it rose, that chanted mournful strain,\r","like some lone spirit's o'er the plain:\r","'twas musical, but sadly sweet,\r","such as when winds and harp-strings meet,\r","and take a long-unmeasured tone,\r","to mortal minstrelsy unknown\r","it seem'd to those within the wall\r","a cry prophetic of their fall:\r","it struck even the besieger's ear\r","an undefined and sudden thrill,\r","which makes the heart a moment still,\r","then beat with quicker pulse, ashamed\r","of that strange sense its silence framed:\r","such as a sudden passing-bell\r","wakes though but for a stranger's knell\r","   \r","the tent of alp was on the shore;\r","the sound was hush'd, the prayer was o'er;\r","the watch was set, the night-round made,\r","all mandates issued and obey'd:\r","'tis but another anxious night,\r","his pains the morrow may requite\r","with all revenge and love can pay,\r","in guerdon for their long delay\r","few hours remain, and he hath need\r","of rest, to nerve for many a deed\r","of slaughter; but within his soul\r","the thoughts like troubled waters roll\r","he stood alone among the host;\r","not his the loud fanatic boast\r","to plant the crescent o'er the cross\r","or risk a life with little loss,\r","secure in paradise to be\r","by houris loved immortally:\r","nor his, what burning patriots feel,\r","the stern exaltedness of zeal,\r","profuse of blood, untired in toil,\r","when battling on the parent soil\r","he stood alone — a renegade\r","against the country he betray'd\r","he stood alone amidst his band,\r","without a trusted heart or hand:\r","they follow'd him, for he was brave,\r"," \r","and great the spoil he got and gave;\r","they crouch'd to him, for he had skill\r","to warp and wield the vulgar will:\r","but still his christian origin\r","with them was little less than sin\r","they envied even the faithless fame\r","he earn'd beneath a moslem name:\r","since he, their mightiest chief had been\r","in youth, a bitter nazarene\r","they did not know how pride can stoop,\r","when baffled feelings withering droop;\r","they did not know how hate can burn\r","in hearts once changed from soft to stern;\r","nor all the false and fatal zeal\r","the convert of revenge can feel\r","he ruled them — man may rule the worst\r","by ever daring to be first:\r","so lions o'er the jackal sway;\r","the jackal points, he fells the prey,\r","then on the vulgar yelling press,\r","to gorge the relics of success\r","  xi\r","his head grows fever'd, and his pulse\r","the quick successive throbs convulse;\r","in vain from side to side he throws\r","his form, in courtship of repose;\r","or if he dozed, a sound, a start\r","awoke him with a sunken heart\r","the turban on his hot brow press'd,\r","the mail weigh'd lead-like on his breast,\r","though oft and long beneath its weight\r","upon his eyes had slumber sate,\r","without or couch or canopy,\r","except a rougher field and sky\r","than now might yield a warrior's bed,\r","than now along the heaven was spread\r","he could not rest, he could not stay\r","within his tent to wait for day,\r","but walk'd him forth along the sand,\r","where thousand sleepers strew'd the strand\r","  \r","what pillow'd them? and why should he\r","more wakeful than the humblest be?\r","since more their peril, worse their toil,\r","and yet they fearless dream of spoil;\r","while he alone, where thousands pass'd\r","a night of sleep, perchance their last,\r","in sickly vigil wander'd on,\r","and envied all he gazed upon\r","   \r","he felt his soul become more light\r","beneath the freshness of the night\r","cool was the silent sky, though calm,\r","and bathed his brow with airy balm:\r","behind, the camp — before him lay,\r","in many a winding creek and bay,\r","lepanto's gulf; and on the brow\r","of delphi's hill, unshaken snow,\r","high and eternal, such as shone\r","through thousand summers brightly gone\r","along the gulf, the mount, the clime;\r","it will not melt, like man, to time;\r","tyrant and slave are swept away,\r","less form'd to wear the before the ray;\r","but that white veil, the lightest, frailest,\r","which on the mighty mount thou hailest,\r","shines o'er its craggy battlement;\r","in form a peak, in height a cloud,\r","in texture like a hovering shroud,\r","thus high by parting freedom spread,\r","as from her fond abode she fled,\r","and linger'd on the spot, where long\r","her prophet spirit spake in song\r","oh! still her step at moments falters\r","o'er wither'd fields, and ruined altars,\r","and fain would wake, in souls too broken,\r","by pointing to each glorious token\r","but vain her voice, till better days\r","dawn in those yet remember'd rays,\r","which shone upon the persian flying,\r","and saw the spartan smile in dying\r","            xv\r","not mindless of these mighty times\r","was alp, despite his flight and crimes;\r","and through this night, as on he wander'd,\r","and o'er the past and present ponder'd,\r","and thought upon the glorious dead\r","who there in better cause had bled,\r","he felt how faint and feebly dim\r","the fame that could accrue to him,\r","who cheer'd the band, and waved the sword\r","a traitor in a turban'd horde;\r","and led them to the lawless siege,\r","whose best success were sacrilege\r","not so had those his fancy number'd,\r","the chiefs whose dust around him slumber'd;\r","their phalanx marshall'd on the plain,\r","whose bulwarks were not then in vain\r","they fell devoted, but undying;\r","the very gale their names seem'd sighing:\r","the waters murmur'd of their name;\r","the woods were peopled with their fame;\r","the silent pillar, lone and gray,\r","claim'd kindred with their sacred clay;\r","their spirits wrapt the dusky mountain,\r","their memory sparkled o'er the mountain,\r","the meanest rill, the mightiest river,\r","roll'd mingling with their fame for ever\r","despite of every yoke she bears,\r","that land is glory's still, and theirs!\r","when man would do a deed of worth\r","he points to greece, and turns to tread,\r","so sanction'd, on the tyrant's head:\r","he looks to her, and rushes on\r","where life is lost, or freedom won\r","     xvi\r","still by the shore alp mutely mused,\r","and woo'd the freshness night diffused\r","there shrinks no ebb in that tideless sea, \r"," \r","which changeless rolls eternally;\r","so that wildest of waves, in their angriest mood,\r","scarce break on the bounds of the land for a rood;\r","and the powerless moon beholds them flow,\r","heedless if she come or go:\r","calm or high, in main or bay,\r","on their course she hath no sway\r","the rock unworn its base doth bare,\r","and looks o'er the surf, but it comes not there;\r","and the fringe of the foam may be seen below,\r","on the line that it left long ages ago:\r","a smooth short space of yellow sand\r","between it and the greener land\r","he wander'd on, along the beach,\r","till within the range of a carbine's reach\r","of the leaguer'd wall; but they saw him not,\r","or how could he 'scape from the hostile shot,\r","did traitors lurk in the christian's hold?\r","were their hands grown stiff, or their hearts wax'd cold,\r","i know not, in sooth; but from yonder wall\r","there flash'd no fire, and there hiss'd no ball,\r","though he stood beneath the bastion's frown,\r","that flank'd the sea-ward gate of the town;\r","though he heard the sound, and could almost tell\r","the sullen words of the sentinel,\r","as his measured step on the stone below\r","clank'd, as he paced it to and fro;\r","and he saw the lean dogs beneath the wall\r","hold o'er the dead their carnival,\r","gorging and growling o'er carcass and limb!\r","they were too busy to bark at him!\r","from a tartar's skull they had stripp'd the flesh,\r","as ye peel the fig when its fruit is fresh;\r","and their white tusks crunch'd o'er the whiter skull, \r","as it slipped through their jaws, when their edge grew dull,\r","as they lazily mumbled the bones of the dead,\r","when they scarce could rise from the spot where they fed;\r","so well had they broken a lingering fast\r","with those who had fall'n for that night's repast\r","and alp knew, by the turbans that roll'd on the sand,\r","the foremost of these were the best of his band:\r","        \r","crimson and green were the shawls of their wear,\r","and each scalp had a single long tuft of hair, \r","all the rest was shaven and bare\r","the scalps were in the wild-dog's maw,\r","the hair was tangled round his jaw\r","but close by the shore, on the edge of the gulf,\r","there sat a vulture flapping a wolf,\r","who had stolen from the hills, but kept away,\r","scared by the dogs, from the human prey;\r","but he seized on his share of a steed that lay,\r","pick'd by the birds, on the sands of the bay\r","      xv\r","alp turn'd him from the sickening sight:\r","never had shaken his nerves in fight;\r","be he better could brook to behold the dying,\r","deep in the tide of their warm blood lying,\r","scorch'd with death-thirst, and writing in vain,\r","than the perishing dead who are past all pain\r","there is something of pride in the perilous hour,\r","whate'er be the shape in which death may lour;\r","for fame is there to say who bleeds,\r","and honour's eye on daring deeds!\r","but when all is past, it is humbling to tread\r","o'er the weltering field of the tombless dead,\r","and see worms of the earth, and fowls of the air,\r","beasts of the forest, all gathering there;\r","all regarding man as their prey,\r","all rejoicing in his decay\r","   xvi\r","there is a temple in ruin stands,\r","fashion'd by long-forgotten hands;\r","two or three columns, and many a stone,\r","marble and granite, with grass o'ergrown!\r","out upon time! it will leave no more\r","of the things to come than the things before!\r","but enough of the past for the future to grieve\r","o'er that which hath been, and o'er that which must be!\r","what we have seen, our sons shall see;\r","   \r","remnants of things that have pass'd away,\r","fragments of stone, rear'd by creatures of clay!\r","    xi\r","he sate him down at a pillar's base,\r","and pass'd his hand athwart his face;\r","like one in dreary musing mood,\r","declining was his attitude;\r","his head was drooping on his breast,\r","fever'd, throbbing, and opprest;\r","and o'er his brow, so downward bent,\r","oft his beating fingers went,\r","hurriedly, as you may see\r","your own run over the ivory key,\r","ere the measured tone is taken,\r","by the chords you would awaken\r","there he sate all heavily,\r","as he heard the night-wind sigh\r","was it the wind, through some hollow stone, \r","sent that soft and tender moan?\r","he lifted his head, and he look'd on the sea,\r","but it was unrippled as glass may be;\r","he look'd on the long grass — it waved not a blade;\r","how was that gentle sound convey'd?\r","he look'd to the banners — each flag lay still,\r","so did the leaves on citharon's hill,\r","and he felt not a breath come over his cheek;\r","what did that sudden sound bespeak?\r","he turn'd to the left — is he sure of sight?\r","there sate a lady, youthful and bright!\r","   \r","he started up with more of fear\r","than if an armed foe were near\r","\"god of my fathers! what is here?\r","who art thou, and wherefore sent\r","so near a hostile armament?\"\r","his trembling hands refused to sign\r","the cross he deem'd no more divine:\r","he had resumed it in that hour,\r","but conscience wrung away the power\r","he gazed — he saw: he knew the face\r","of beauty, and the form of grace;\r","it was francesca by his side,\r","the maid who might have been his bride!\r","the rose was yet upon her cheek,\r","but mellow'd with a tenderer streak:\r","where was the play of her soft lips fled?\r","gone was the smile that enliven'd their red\r","the ocean's calm within their view,\r","beside her eye had less of blue;\r","but like that cold wave it stood still,\r","and its glance, though clear, was chill\r","around her form a thin robe twining,\r","nought conceal'd her bosom shining;\r","through the parting of her hair,\r","floating darkly downward there,\r","her rounded arm shew'd white and bare:\r","and ere yet she made reply,\r","once she raised her hand on high;\r","it was so wan and transparent of hue,\r","you might have seen the moon shine through\r","     \r","\"i come from my rest to him i love best,\r","that i may be happy, and he may be blest\r","i have pass'd the guards, the gate, the wall;\r","sought thee in safety through foes and all\r","'tis said the lion will turn and flee\r","from a maid in the pride of her purity;\r","and the power on high, that can shield the good\r","thus from the tyrant of the wood,\r","hath extended its mercy to guard me as well\r","from the hands of the leaguering infidel\r","i come — and if i come in vain,\r","never, oh never, we meet again!\r","thou hast done a fearful deed\r","in falling away from thy fathers' creed:\r","but dash that turban to earth, and sign\r","the sign of the cross, and for ever be mine;\r","  \r","wring the black drop from thy heart,\r","and to-morrow unites us no more to part\"\r","\"and where should our bridal-couch be spread?\r","in the midst of the dying and the dead?\r","for to-morrow we give to the slaughter and flame\r","the sons

sorrow forgot\r","there thou yet shall be my bride,\r","when once again i've quell'd the pride\r","of venice: and her hated race\r","have felt the arm they would debase\r","scourge, with a whip of scorpions, those\r","whom vice and envy made my foes\"\r","upon his hand she laid her own —\r","light was the touch, but it thrill'd to the bone,\r","and shot a chillness to his heart,\r","which fix'd him beyond the power to start\r","though slight was that grasp so mortal cold,\r","he could not lose him from its hold:\r","but never did clasp of one so dear\r","strike on the pulse with such feeling of fear,\r","as those thin fingers, long and white,\r","froze through his blood by their touch that night\r","the feverish glow of his brow was gone,\r","and his heart sank so still that it felt like stone,\r","as he look'd on the face, and beheld its hue,\r","so deeply changed from what he knew:\r","fair but faint — without the ray\r","of mind, that made each feature play\r","like sparkling waves on a sunny day;\r","and her motionless lips lay still as death,\r","and her words came forth without her breath,\r","and there rose not a heave o'er her bosom's swell,\r","and there seem'd not a pulse in her veins to dwell\r","though her eye shone out, yet the lids were fix'd,\r","and the glance that it gave was wild and unmix'd\r","with aught of change, as the eyes may seem\r","   \r","of the restless who walk in a troubled dream:\r","like the figures on arras, that gloomily glare,\r","stirr'd by the breath of the wintry air,\r","so seen by the dying lamp's fitful light,\r","lifeless, but life-like, and awful to sight;\r","as they seem, through the dimness, about to come down\r","from the shadowy wall where their images frown;\r","fearfully flitting to and fro,\r","as the gusts on the tapestry come and go\r"," \"if not for the love of me be given\r"," thus much, then, for the love of heaven, —\r"," again i say — that turban tear\r"," from off thy faithless brow, and swear\r","

heaven, and saw on high\r","the sign she spake of in the sky;\r","but his heart was swoll'n, and turn'd aside,\r","by deep interminable pride\r","this first false passion of his breast\r","roll'd like a torrent o'er the rest\r","he sue for mercy! he dismay'd\r","by wild words of a timid maid!\r","he, wrong'd by venice, vow to save\r"," \r"," her sons, devoted to the grave!\r","no — though that

with heavy splash,\r","from the cliffs invading dash\r","huge fragments, sapp'd by the ceaseless flow,\r","till white and thundering down they go,\r","like the avalanche's snow\r","on the alpine vales below;\r","thus at length, outbreathed and worn,\r","corinth's sons were downward borne\r","by the long and oft-renew'd\r","charge of the moslem multitude\r","in firmness they stood, and in masses they fell,\r","heap'd, by the host of the infidel,\r","hand to hand, and foot to foot:\r","nothing there, save death, was mute;\r","stroke, and thrust, and flash, and cry\r","for quarter, or for victory,\r","mingle there with the volleying thunder,\r","which makes the distant cities wonder\r","how the sounding battle goes,\r","if with them, or for their foes;\r","if they must mourn, or may rejoice\r","in that annihilating voice,\r","which pierces the deep hills through and through\r","with an echo dread and new:\r","you might have heard it, on that day,\r","o'er salamis and megara;\r","we have heard the hearers say,\r","even unto piraus' bay\r","    \r","from the point of encountering blades to the hilt,\r","sabres and swords with blood were gilt:\r","but the rampart is won, and the spoil begun\r","and all but the after carnage done\r","shriller shrieks now mingling come\r","from within the plunder'd dome:\r","     \r","hark to the haste of flying feet,\r","that splash in the blood of the slippery street;\r","but here and there, where 'vantage ground\r","against the foe may still be found,\r","desperate groups, of twee or ten,\r","make a pause, and turn again —\r","with banded backs against the wall,\r","fiercely stand, or fighting fall\r","there stood an old man — his hairs were white,\r","but his veteran arm was full of might:\r","so gallantly bore he the brunt of the fray,\r","the dead before him on that day,\r","in a semicircle lay;\r","still he combated unwounded,\r","though retreating, unsurrounded\r","many a scar of former fight\r","lurk'd beneath his corslet bright;\r","but of every wound his body bore,\r","each and all had been ta'en before:\r","though aged, he was so iron of limb,\r","few of our youth could cope with him;\r","and the foes, whom he singly kept at bay,\r","outnumber'd his thin hairs of sier gray\r","from right to left his sabre swept:\r","many an othman mother wept\r","sons that were unborn, when dipp'd\r","his weapon first in moslem gore,\r","ere his years could count a score\r","of all he might have been the sire\r","who fell that day beneath his ire:\r","for, sonless left long years ago,\r","his wrath made many a childless foe;\r","and since the day, when in the strait \r","his only boy had met his fate,\r","his parent's iron hand did doom\r","more than a human hecatomb\r","if shades by carnage be appeased,\r","patroclus' spirit less was pleased\r","than his, minotti's son, who died\r","where asia's bounds and ours divide,\r","buried he lay, where thousands before\r","   \r","for thousands of years were inhumed on the shore;\r","what of them is left, to tell\r","where they lie, and how they fell?\r","not a stone on their turf, nor a bone in their graves;\r","but they live in the verse that immortally saves\r","    \r","hark to the allah shout! a band\r","of the mussulman bravest and best is at hand:\r","their leader's nervous arm is bare,\r","swifter to smite, and never to spare —\r","unclothed to the shoulder it waves them on;\r","thus in the fight is he ever known:\r","others a gaudier garb may show,\r","to them the spoil of the greedy foe;\r","many a hand's on a richer hilt,\r","but none on a steel more ruddily gilt;\r","many a loftier turban may wear, —\r","alp is but known by the white arm bare;\r","look through the thick of the fight, 'tis there!\r","there is not a standard on the shore\r","so well advanced the ranks before;\r","there is not a banner in moslem war\r","will lure the delis half so far;\r","it glances like a falling star!\r","where'er that mighty arm is seen,\r","the bravest be, or late have been;\r","there the craven cries for quarter\r","vainly to the vengeful tartar;\r","or the hero, silent lying,\r","scorns to yield a groan in dying;\r","mustering his last feeble blow\r","'gainst the nearest levell'd foe,\r","though faint beneath the mutual wound,\r","grappling on the gory ground\r","  \r","still the old man stood erect,\r","and alp's career a moment check'd\r","\"yield thee, minotti; quarter take,\r","  \r","for thine own, thy daughter's sake\"\r","\"never, renegado, never!\r","though the life of thy gift

—\r","nor weep i for her spirit's flight:\r","none of my pure race shall be\r","slaves to mohammed and thee —\r","come on!\" that challenge is in vain —\r","alp's already with the slain!\r","while minotti's words were wreaking\r","more revenge in bitter speaking\r","than his falchion's point had found,\r","had the time allow'd to wound,\r","from within the neighbouring porch\r","of a long-defended church,\r","where the last and desperate few\r","would the failing fight renew,\r","the sharp shot dash'd alp to the ground;\r","ere an eye could view the wound\r","that crash'd through the brain of the infidel,\r","round he spun, and down he fell;\r","a flash like fire within his eyes\r","blazed, as he bent no more to rise,\r","and then eternal darkness sunk\r","through all the palpitating trunk;\r","nought of life left, save a quivering\r","where his limbs were slightly shivering:\r","they turn'd him on his back; his breast\r","and brow were stain'd with gore and dust,\r","    \r","and through his lips the life-blood oozed,\r","from its deep veins lately loosed;\r","but in his pulse there was no throb,\r","nor on his lips one dying sob;\r","sigh, nor word, nor struggling breath\r","heralded his way to death:\r","ere his very thought could pray,\r","unanel'd he pass'd away,\r","without a hope from mercy's aid, —\r","to the last — a renegade\r"," \r","fearfully the yell arose\r","of his followers, and his foes;\r","these in joy, in fury those:\r","then again in conflict mixing,\r","clashing swords, and spears transfixing,\r","interchanged the blow and thrust,\r","hurling warriors in the dust\r","street by street, and foot by foot,\r","still minotti dares dispute\r","the latest portion of the land\r","left beneath his high command;\r","with him, aiding heart and hand,\r","the remnant of his gallant band\r","still the church is tenable,\r","whence issued the fated ball\r","that half avenged the city's fall,\r","when alp, her fierce assailant, fell:\r","thither bending sternly back,\r","they leave before a bloody track;\r","and, with their faces to the foe,\r","dealing wounds with every blow,\r","the chief, and his retreating train,\r","join to those within the fane;\r","there they yet may breathe awhile,\r","shelter'd by the massy pile\r"," \r","brief breathing-time! the turban'd host,\r"," \r","with added ranks and raging boast,\r","press onwards with such strength and heat,\r","their numbers balk their own retreat;\r","for narrow the way that led to the spot\r","where still the christians yielded not;\r","and the foremost, if fearful, may vainly try\r","through the massy column to turn and fly;\r","they perforce must do or die\r","they die: but ere their eyes could close,\r","avengers o'er their bodies rose;\r","fresh and furious, fast they fill\r","the ranks unthinn'd, though slaughter'd still:\r","and faint the weary christians wa\r","before the still renew'd attacks:\r","and now the othmans gain the gate;\r","still resists its iron weight,\r","and still, all deadly aim'd and hot,\r","from every crevice comes the shot;\r","from every shatter'd window pour\r","the volleys of the sulphurous shower:\r","but the portal wavering grows and weak —\r","the iron yields, the hinges creak —\r","it bends — and falls — and all is o'er;\r","lost corinth may resist no more!\r","  \r","dark, sternly, and all alone,\r","minotti stood o'er the altar stone:\r","madonna's face upon him shone,\r","painted in heavenly hues above,\r","with eyes of light and looks of love;\r","and placed upon that holy shrine\r","to fix our thoughts on things divine,\r","when pictured there we kneeling see\r","her, and the boy-god on her knee,\r","smiling sweetly on each prayer\r","to heaven, as if to waft it there\r","still she smiled; even now she smiles,\r","though slaughter streams along her aisles:\r","minotti lifted his aged eye,\r","and made the sign of a cross with a sigh,\r"," \r","then seized a torch which blazed thereby;\r","and still he stood, while, with steel and flame,\r","inward and onward the mussulman came\r","   \r","the vaults beneath the mosaic stone\r","contain'd the dead of ages gone:\r","their names were on the graven floor,\r","but now illegible with gore;\r","the carved crests, and curious hues\r","the varied marble's veins diffuse,\r","were smear'd, and slippery — stain'd, and strown\r","with broken swords, and helms o'erthrown:\r","there were dead above, and the dead below\r","lay cold in many a coffin'd row;\r","you might see them piled in sable state,\r","by a pale light through a gloomy grate:\r","but war had enter'd their dark caves,\r","and stored along the vaulted graves\r","her sulphurous treasures, thickly spread\r","in masses by the fleshless dead:\r","here, throughout the siege, had been\r","the christians' chiefest magazine;\r","to these a late-form'd train now led,\r","minotti's last and stern resource,\r","against the foe's o'erwhelming force\r","    \r","the foe came on, and few remain\r","to strive, and those must strive in vain:\r","for lack of further lives, to slake\r","the thirst of vengeance now awake,\r","with barbarous blows they gash the dead,\r","and lop the already lifeless head,\r","and fell the statues from their niche,\r","and spoil the shrine of offerings rich,\r","and from each other's rude hands wrest\r","the sier vessels saints had bless'd\r","to the high altar on they go;\r","oh, but it made a glorious show!\r","   \r","on its table still behold\r","the cup of consecrated gold;\r","massy and deep, a glittering prize,\r","brightly it sparkles to plunderers' eyes:\r","that morn it held the holy wine,\r","converted by christ to his blood so divine,\r","which his worshippers drank at the break of day\r","to shrive their souls ere they join'd in the fray,\r","still a few drops within it lay;\r","and round the sacred table glow\r","twee lofty lamps, in splendid row,\r","from the purest metal cast;\r","a spoil — the richest, and the last\r","    \r","so near they came, the nearest stretch'd\r","to grasp the spoil he almost reach'd\r","when old minotti's hand\r","touch'd with a torch the train —\r"," 'tis fired!\r","spire, vaults, and shrine, the spoil, the slain,\r","the turban'd victors, the christian band,\r","all that of living or dead remain,\r","hurl'd on high with the shiver'd fane,\r"," in one wild roar expired!\r","the shatter'd town — the walls thrown down —\r","the waves a moment backward bent —\r","the hills that shake, although unrent,\r"," as if an

again\r","like a cinder strew'd the plain:\r","down the ashes shower like rain;\r","     \r","some fell in the gulf, which received the sprinkles\r","with a thousand circling wrinkles;\r","some fell on the shore, but, far away,\r","scatter'd o'er the isthmus lay;\r","christian or moslem, which be they?\r","let their mothers see and say!\r","when in cradled rest they lay,\r","and each nursing mother smiled\r","on the sweet sleep of her child,\r","little deem'd she such a day\r","would rend those tender limbs away\r","not the matrons that them bore\r","could discern their offspring more;\r","that one moment left no trace\r","more of human form or face\r","save a scatter'd scalp or bone:\r","and down came blazing rafters, strown\r","around, and many a falling stone,\r","deeply dinted in the clay,\r","all blacken'd there and reeking lay\r","all the living things that heard\r","that deadly earth-shock disappear'd\r","the wild birds flew; the wild dogs fled,\r","and howling
